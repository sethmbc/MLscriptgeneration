EXT. STREET - DAY

A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.

UPS MAN

Good morning, UPS!

He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.

UPS MAN

UPS, good to see you!

He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.

UPS MAN

Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package behind him and back down the steps.

He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.

INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY

ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.

We hear a small dog barking.

GRUFF MAN (O.S.)

Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.

GRUFF MAN

What do you want?

UPS MAN

UPS, sir. And how are you this afternoon? Alrighty then!

The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A small Shiatsu stands beside him.

UPS MAN

I have a package for you.

The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The man takes the package.

GRUFF MAN

It sounds broken.

UPS MAN

Most likely sir! I bet it was something nice though! Now... I haver an insurance form. If you'll just sign here, here, and here, and initial here, and print your name here, we'll get the rest of the forms out to you as soon as we can.

The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see that he likes the UPS guy.

UPS MAN

That's a lovely dog you have. Do you mind if I pet him, sir?

GRUFF MAN

(mumbles)

I don't give a rat's ass.

The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.

UPS MAN

Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!

GRUFF MAN

(under breath)

Brother.

Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.

UPS MAN

That's fine sir. I can fill out the rest. You just have yourself a good day. Take care, now! 'Bye 'bye, then!

THRASH MUSIC STARTS

INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D

The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D

The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes several people.

UPS MAN

(quickly)

UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin' through.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. The Gruff Man looks over.

GRUFF MAN

Hey, stupid! Get away from the door!

The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.

GRUFF MAN

What's the matter with you, I said GIT!!!

He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - Pet Detective." He breathes fire.

GRUFF MAN

Son of a bitch!

He smashes the dog to the ground.

EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D

As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head sticks out. Ace is gloating.

ACE

(announcer's voice)

That was a close one, ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately, in every contest, there must be... A LOOSER!

He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.

ACE (CONT'D)

LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!

He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.

He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.

ACE

(to dog)

No problem, it gets flooded. We'll just wait a few seconds.

Ace sits back. SMASH!!!

From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.

ACE

Or, we could try it now.

Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit out of it.

ACE

Oooh, boy.

ACE'S POV

We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.

ACE

Warning! Assholes are closer than they appear!

The dog is barking insanely.

ACE

(to dog)

You think you can do better?!

The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.

ACE

Wanna give me a push while you're back there?

BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.

ACE

FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!

Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.

EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace and his new pal speed away freely.

Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.

The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's seat.

THRASH MUSIC ENDS

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.

WOMAN

My little baby. You missed mommy didn't you? Did daddy hurt you? I won't let him, no I won't. He may have kept the big screen TV, but he's not gonna keep my baby. No he isn't.

(very sexy to Ace)

Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I ever repay you?

She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.

ACE

Well, the reward would be good, and there was some damage to my –

She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.

WOMAN

Would you like me to take you pants off instead?

ACE

Ummmm… Sure.

She pulls him toward the bedroom.

WOMAN

It takes a big man to stand up to my husband. He's already put two of my lovers in the hospital.

ACE

How did he find out? Does he have you followed.

WOMAN

No… I tell him

She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY

The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.

Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.

TRAINER Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.

The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT

The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.

Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.

The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.

They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.

Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.

Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.

Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle has turned into a painful whimper.

The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free himself.

INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY

Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in a bag to JENNIFER, a very sweet nine year old.

ADELLE

Here you go, honey. Now remember… this kind of fish doesn't like it in the freezer.

JENNY

But what's gonna happen to Dolly?

ADELLE

Don't worry, I'll make sure she gets a proper burial.

Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.

ADELLE

Rest in peace.

Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.

ADELLE

Well… here comes another dead fish.

ACE

Hi, beautiful. What time do you get off?

ADELLE

Uh oh.

ACE

(suggestively)

I've heard some pretty great things about your kibble.

ADELLE

Well, I hope I'm not getting a reputation.

ACE

(switching to mock anger)

Just get me the food!

She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.

ADELLE

So… ahh, when can I expect you to pay your tab?

ACE

I'm a little bit Sli Pickins, right now, I'm a little Tight Squeeze Louise, a little Welfare Wolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm ah –

ADELLE

If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'. Just take it.

ACE

Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle. I'm on a very big case right now.

Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.

ACE

See this pigeon? It's a true albino. Some rich guy lost it. He's offering a ten thousand dollar reward.

ADELLE

Wow, albino pigeons are very rare. How are you going to find him?

ACE

Just keep my eyes open, and hope to god it doesn't snow.

Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.

ADELLE

You're a good boy, Ace. A good boy.

He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the floor. Ace and Adelle just stare.

ELDERLY MAN

(in a loud voice)

Do you have anything for ringworm?

EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).

LANDLORD

Venturaaaaa?

Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.

ACE

Yes, Satan?

Now Ace turns around in mock surprise.

ACE

Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded like someone else.

LANDLORD

Never mind the wise cracks Venturaaa. You owe me rent!

ACE

Mr. Shickadance… I told you, you're my first priority! As soon as I find the white pigeon, you're paid!!

LANDLORD

I heard animals in there Ventura! I heard 'em again this morning, scratchin' around.

ACE

I never bring my work home with me, sir.

The landlord notices the bags of kibble.

LANDLORD

Oh, yeah? What's all this pet food for?

ACE

(beat)

Fiber.

The landlord isn't buying it.

ACE

You wanna take a look for yourself? Go head.

Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.

ACE

Well… are you satisfied?

LANDLORD

(still suspicious)

Yeah, but don't ever let me catch you with an animal in there, that's all!

ACE

Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye 'bye.

The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.

ACE

(quietly to himself)

LLOOSER.

He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.

CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.

ACE

(to his flock)

Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!

INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY

The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.

RIDDLE

I just want to know one thing; How the hell do you lose a 500 pound fish?!

Melissa's about to speak but hesitates.

RIDDLE (CONT.)

What?

MELISSA

It's not a fish, sir. It's a mammal.

An angry Riddle stands up.

RIDDLE

Oh, thank you very much, Mrs. Jacque Cousteau!

PODACTER

Bob, she didn't mean anything by it.

RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.

RIDDLE

(calmer)

Listen, personally, I don't give a good god damn about a fish.

He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.

RIDDLE (CONT.)

All I care about is winning this Super Bowl! I want the players' head in the right place. Shit, Roger, you've been in this game long enough, you know how superstitious players are. Our quarterback's been putting his socks on backwards since high school. And I got a lineman who hasn't washed his jock in two years because he thinks flies are lucky! I want that god damn fish on the field Super Bowl Sunday! FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.

PODACTER

Why did it have to happen now? I got three stinking years left till retirement.

MELISSA

I've got forty.

PODACTER

I'll tell you who did it. It was those goddamn animal rights nuts! Always out there with their goddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORN FREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE! That goddamn fish lives better than they do!

They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.

MELISSA

The police are checking into the animal rights people.

(to secretary)

Martha, have the police called back about the dolphin yet?

MARTHA

No, but I wanted to tell you, when I lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet detective.

PODACTER

A what?

MARTHA

A pet detective.

MELISSA

Thanks Martha, but we'd better leave this to professionals.

MARTHA

Well actually, he was quite good. Pet detection is a very involved, highly scientific process.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.

ACE

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the building and slides down the side of the roof.

EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION

BAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Parking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.

INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY

A stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection wand.

MAN #1

Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.

The guard scans him. He goes.

MAN #2

Tom Anderson. Concessions.

The guard scans him. He goes.

ACE

Ace Ventura. Pet detective.

The guard stares at Ace, accusingly.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

Martha enters.

MARTHA

Ah… Mr. Ventura to see you.

MELISSA

Okay, send him in.

Martha exits, Ace enters.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you have any trouble getting in?

ACE

No, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle.

MELISSA

(apologetically)

Super Bowl week. Security's tight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get right to the point…

She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.

MELISSA

Our mascot was stolen from his tank last night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out signals.

TRAINER (ON TAPE) Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.

MELISSA (O.S.)

We got Snowflake from the Miami Seaquarium. He's a rare Bottle Nose Dolphin. That's the new trick he was going to do during the half-time show.

While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a neat little pile on her desk.

MELISSA

Would you like an ashtray?

ACE

No, I don't smoke.

He adds more shells to the pile.

Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.

MELISSA

To be honest, Mr. Ventura. I'm pretty skeptical. Before today, I didn't even know there was such a thing as a pet detective.

ACE

Well, now that you do, you'll know who to call if your Schnauser ever runs away.

MELISSA

How did you know I have a Schnauser?

Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.

ACE

He's young, about five pounds, black coat, white speckles…

(sniffs the hair)

…likes to chase cars.

MELISSA

Very impressive.

ACE

You should see what I can do with a good stool sample.

MELISSA

I can hardly wait. Look, we've got a problem. Can you help me or not?

ACE

(coy)

Well, sea faring creatures aren't really my expertise…

MELISSA

We'll give you three thousand dollars on delivery.

Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.

ACE

The dolphin is a social creature. Capable of complex communication. Traveling in large groups or schools…

EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER

The Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.

MARINO

We just choked in 82. We had a chance to win it and we didn't. Nobody's gonna choke this time, and if they do, I'll kill 'em.

Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.

MELISSA

The police were here this morning. Apparently, the kidnappers used the back gate.

Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

They said some kind of a –

ACE

Four wheel drive van… loaded from the rear.

Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.

MELISSA

Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holding up?

PODACTER

Well if it looks like I'm walking funny it's because I have a bunch on reporters up my ass. They've been asking me about Snowflake all day. Who's this?

MELISSA

Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura. Ace is our pet detective.

Podacter shakes his hand.

PODACTER

Nice to meet you. Martha Metz recommended you very highly.

ACE

Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh yeah, the bitch.

PODACTER

What?

ACE

Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in Highland Park area. She was half dead when I found her. Is that the tank?

They both follow Ace as he makes a B-line.

EXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER

The tank is empty.

ACE

Cops drain it?

MELISSA

Yes. This morning.

Ace hops on the ladder.

ACE

If I'm not back in five minutes… call Lloyd Bridges.

INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER

While eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper."

ACE

…Wonderful Flipper… glorious Flipper… magnificent Flipper… The flippiest Flipper…

Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten ourselves into?" Podacter spots something.

PODACTER

Oh, great.

A hoard or reporters are headed their way.

PODACTER (CONT)

I'll try to head them off.

MELISSA

(to Ace)

Get out of the tank.

ACE

(still singing)

…Can't hear you Flipper, Flipper… Lookin' for Flipper, gotta find Flipper…

MELISSA

I said, get out of the tank! Now!

The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.

REPORTER

So where's Snowflake?

PODACTER

Ah… Snowflake is just, ah, not available right now.

REPORTER

Come on, I'm supposed to get a shot of his new trick for the evening news.

REPORTER #2

What? Is he sick?

Other reporters chime in.

VARIOUS REPORTERS Did something happen to Snowflake?! What're you hiding..?!

Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.

ACE/HEINZ (O.S.)

(unrecognizable accent)

How cun I be getting dis vork dun mit all da shouting? What for is dis shouting?

REPORTER

Who the hell is that?

MELISSA

That? That's…

ACE/HEINZ

Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of Dolphins. You vant to talk to ze dolphin, you talk to me!

REPORTER

What happened to the regular trainer?

ACE/HEINZ

Vy do you care about the dolphin? Do you know him? Does he call you at home? Do you have a dorsal fin?

(beat)

To train ze dolphin, you must zink like ze dolphin. You must be getting oonside ze dolphin's head! Just yesterday I'm asking Snowflake… "ee, eee, eee." He said, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Und you can quote him.

Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.

PODACTER

Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula's press conference is just about to begin. Why don't I take you over there and let, ah, Heinz, do his job.

He ushers the press away.

MELISSA

(sotto to Ace)

Are you finished, Heinz?

ACE

Not yet.

Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents – mainly leaves, small twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.

ACE

Now I'm finished.

EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

A flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.

AGUADO

Hey, Ventura! Make any good collars lately?

ANOTHER COP Or were they leashes?

They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.

AGUADO

Uh oh.

(steps on the bug)

Homicide, Ventura!

The cops are falling all over themselves laughing.

AGUADO

How you gonna solve this one?!

Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.

ACE

Good question, Aguado… first I'd establish a motive. In this case the killer saw the size of the bug's dick, and became insanely jealous.

The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face with him.

ACE

Then I'd lose thirty pounds porking his wife.

Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.

With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead bug.

ACE

Now kiss and make up.

Ace walks off.

ACE

(to himself)

LLLOOOSER!

Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.

ACE

(playfully)

I miss you.

EMILIO

It's not a good time, Ace. If Einhorn sees me talking to you I'm gonna be history.

ACE

Okay. Just tell me what you got on Snowflake. That's all I need.

EMILIO

…I can't say anything. My hands are tied.

ACE

(effeminate)

SOUNDS LIKE MY KIND OF A PARTY.

A cop comes to Emilio's desk.

COP

LOOK ALIVE, EINHORN'S ON HER WAY DOWN.

EMILIO

Ace, please?!

ACE

Just tell me who's working the case?

EMILIO

Aguado.

ACE

Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He's the poster child for lead paint chip eaters!

EMILIO

Look, Ace. We're a little busy with murderers and drug dealers. A missing dolphin isn't exactly a high priority.

The elevator is getting closer.

EMILIO

Ace, gimme a break will ya?

Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.

EMILIO

(quickly)

Okay, okay. We checked all the local animal rights groups, taxidermists, and we're running a check through DMV on all recent van rentals. So far, nada.

ACE

Any unusual bets being made?

EMILIO

Ace, it's the Super Bowl, of course there's bets being made.

ACE

What'd you find out about the tank?

EMILIO

Nothing weird. Just the tire tracks and the exit route. The guard didn't see anything.

ACE

That's it?

EMILIO

That's it. I swear. Now please go away!

ACE

You know something?

(again impish)

YOU'RE NICE!

Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.

ACE

What about crazy Philly fans?

The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a great pair of legs and a bad tude.

ACE

Holy Testicle Tuesday!

EINHORN

(to Emilio)

What the hell is he doing here?

ACE

I came to confess. I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll.

EINHORN

Spare me the routine, Ventura. I know you're working the Snowflake case. May I suggest you yield to the experts on this one? We'll find the porpoise.

ACE

(mock relief)

Whewww… now I feel better!

Ace turns to go.

ACE (CONT)

Of course, that might not do any good. You see, nobody's missing a porpoise. It's a dolphin that's been taken. The common Harbor Porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth, and a triangular thorasic fin, while the Bottlenose Dolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus, has an elongated beak, round, cone-shaped teeth, and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage. (beat) But I'm sure you already knew that. (beat) That's what turns me on about you. Hey… maybe I'll give you a call sometime, lieutenant. Your number still 911? Alrighty then!

Ace exits.

CUT TO:

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the moshing pit.

Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.

ACE

(shouting)

Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!

The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.

ACE

Thank you!

Ace heads for the basement stairs.

INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

Ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is heard from inside.

VOICE (O.S.)

Password!

ACE

Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You can too!

CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Ace enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have their own distinct banter.

A thud from above. Ace looks up.

ACE'S POV

Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.

ACE

(to burnout)

Found him!

WOODSTOCK

Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin?

ACE

Super, and thank you for asking. Hope you're having a nice day.

WOODSTOCK

Do you?

ACE

Don't I? And what are you up to?

WOODSTOCK

Just watching the fishies, man.

There is a BLIP on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK

Alright, you're just in time for the party. You see those blips?

ACE

I certainly do.

ON THE SCREEN

A map with several ships on the ocean.

He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.

WOODSTOCK

That's a Norwegian whaling fleet. I'm sending them new directional coordinates… They'll find Jimmy Hoffa before they find any Humpbacks.

ACE

Gravy.

Woodstock moves to a different screen.

WOODSTOCK

Check this out.

More computer graphics come up on the screen.

WOODSTOCK

Just changed the formula for Purina's puppy chow.

(turns to Ace)

Too much filler, don't ya' think?

ACE

(acting turned on)

I'm very attracted to you right now.

Woodstock chuckles.

WOODSTOCK

Are you?

ACE

Aren't I? Can you still tap into all the aquatic supply store in the area?

WOODSTOCK

Of course I can. Why?

ACE

I want to trace the sale of any equipment for transporting or housing a dolphin within the past few months…

WOODSTOCK

C'mon, Ace. I thought you might have a challenge for me…

Woodstock starts hacking away.

ACE

Okay then, try to remember the sixties.

WOODSTOCK

Wow! God one! Let's see… Marine winch sling, feeder fish, 20,000 gallon tank…

He waits. We hear a beep.

WOODSTOCK

That's it. I found the culprit.

ACE

Who is it?

WOODSTOCK

(dramatically)

…Sea World.

ACE

…bastard.

WOODSTOCK

Hang on, hang on…

(He taps a couple keys)

Well, what do we have here? That's a lot of equipment for a civilian.

The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.

ACE

Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

WOODSTOCK

Billionaire and rare fish collector.

ACE

RRREHEHEALLY!

A PICTURE OF CAMP

Comes up on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK

That, my friend, is the face of the enemy.

He pages through his file on screen.

WOODSTOCK

…Always tryin' to get his hands on endangered species…

Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.

ACE

Hold on, this guy's connected with the Dolphins?

Ace leans in.

WOODSTOCK

Camp donated the land the new stadium's built on.

(re: article)

Oh, look at this, he's throwin' another, "I'm the richest man in the universe" party.

ACE

(thinking)

Hmmm… I wonder if I can find myself a date.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

It's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.

DAN

We just choked in 82. We had a chance to win and we didn't. But nobody's gonna choke this time; if they do, I'll kill 'em!

Everybody laughs.

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.

MELISSA

I'm really going out on a limb here, Ventura. Camp's social events are strictly A-list.

ACE

(a la Love Connection)

'Well, Chuck… the date started off good, but just before we got to the party, she seemed to tense up.'

Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.

MELISSA

I swear, if you do anything to embarrass me in front of Camp…

ACE

You mean like this?

Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.

ACE

Owwwe!!!

He sees the butler.

ACE

Oh, hi Captain Stubing.

Melissa storms in, already pissed.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT

Ace and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.

CAMP

Melissa! Glad you could make it! Oh, and who is this?

MELISSA

This is my date. He's a… lawyer.

CAMP

Well, does he have a name, or should I call him "Lawyer"?

MELISSA

I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.

Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.

ACE

Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you, Mr. Camp, and congratualtions on all your success. You smell terrific.

CAMP

Ah, well, thank you. Please, come in.

Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.

MELISSA

(sotto)

This is insane. There's no way that Camp stole Snowflake.

ACE

(spreading pate' on a cracker)

Will you just keep him occupied, while I work my magic please.

She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.

ACE

(with a mouthful, to man)

Smooshy, isn't it?

Off the stuffy man's reaction…

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

Ace approaches Camp.

ACE

Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the bathroom?

(palms his stomach, whispering loudly)

I think it's the pate'.

CAMP

Um, it's just over there.

ACE

Thanks. Stuff probably looks better on the way out, huh?

Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - CONT

Ace wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens and climbs out a window.

EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT

Ace drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT

Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He continues on towards a large door.

INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the large door and enters.

ACE

Gravy.

Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there.

CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.

He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and dangles the fish over the water.

ACE

(gently)

Snowflake… Here, Snowflake… Snooowflaaaake…

A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH FROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.

He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME

Melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.

CAMP

Wonderful, aren't they?

MELISSA

(nervously)

Yes. They're incredible.

CAMP

No matter what is going on in my life, I can always watch them swim and be completely at peace.

INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME

The water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.

ACE

(frantic, to himself)

It's not Snowflake… It's not Snowflake.

Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the pool.

ACE

(screaming)

IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAA!!!

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

A line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.

CAMP

Are you sure he's okay? It's been an awfu;;y long time.

MELISSA

Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.

ACE

(loudly to the entire room)

DO NOT GO IN THERE!

(fanning the air)

Whewww!!

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

Ace and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.

CAMP

(still confused)

I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll have the pluming checked immediately.

ACE

Be sure that you do. If I had been drinking out of that toilet, I might have been killed!

Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, commemorative ring.

Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.

MELISSA

We'd better go.

Camp looks on and shakes his head.

INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT

Ace is thinking. Melissa is pissed.

MELISSA

…Y'know, I don't even want to know why your pants are missing! I don't care what happened! You could have cost me my job.

ACE

(on his own wavelength)

I was wrong about Camp. He's breaking the law but he's not our guy.

MELISSA

It's a sure thing! It's definitely him! Just get me in there! Let me work my magic!

Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.

ACE

This is the key. Right here!

MELISSA

Hiring you was the biggest mistake I ever made!

ACE

So small! So unnoticeable! Yet an invaluable piece… of our twisted little jigsaw puzzle!

Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search for it frantically.

ACE

Damn it!

(to Melissa)

Try to keep it on the road.

INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM

Melissa enters, followed by Ace.

MELISSA

So, you found a pebble in Snowflake's tank. Excuse me while I call CNN.

ACE

I found it in the filter. And it's not a pebble. It is a rare, triangular cut, orange amber.

Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.

MELISSA

What are you talking about?

ACE

Tonight I saw the exact same stone in Camp's ring.

Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.

MELISSA

I thought you said he didn't do it.

ACE

N. Camp's clean. His ring wasn't missing a stone. But whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his.

MELISSA

Wait a second. What ring?

Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of…

ACE

The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship ring.

Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.

ACE

I find the ring with the missing stone, I find Snowflake.

MELISSA

How are you gonna do that?

ACE

Simple.

MUSIC UP

CUT TO:

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.

INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY

Ace sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.

CLOSE ON

A poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Pan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man leaves him in the dust.

INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

Two big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He is instantly thrown across the room.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.

EXT. STREET

Ace spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.

Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

One huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it changes to a "come on" smile.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.

EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING

Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.

MELISSA

Ace, that stone could have come from anywhere. An earring, a necklace…

ACE

(with murder in his eyes)

It came from an '82 AFC Championship ring.

MELISSA

Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an animal rights group. Have you heard of FAN?

ACE

Free Animals Now? Started in 1982 by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the famous industrialist, Fischer Gamble? Over half a million members from Florida to Finland?

(beat)

No. Who are they?

MELISSA

Did you know that last year they sent threatening letters to 127 college teams, demanding the release of their mascots? At last count –

ACE

What do you feed your dog?

We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.

MELISSA

Ah… dog food, why?

ACE

He's miserable.

MELISSA

What are you talking about?

ACE

He's just very unhappy, I feel sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated environment. It's amazing he's still alive.

MELISSA

You're just mad because your stupid pebble theory didn't work out and you don't know how to express your anger.

ACE

Yeah? And you're ugly.

MELISSA

I'm not even gonna' talk to you, please leave.

ACE

What, so you can beat him? Fatty!

MELISSA

You… are unbelievable.

The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.

MELISSA

Hiring you was a huge mistake!

The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.

ACE

You like her, huh?… Yeah, she's alright.

Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.

INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT

Ace walks toward Melissa.

ACE

Look, Melissa, I, ah…

Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.

EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Chaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.

Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.

ACE

You okay?

Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.

ACE

What'd you find?

EMILIO

Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide. He was alone. He'd been drinking. No sign of a struggle. Neighbor heard him scream on the way down. Just your classic fifteen story swan dive.

Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look.

EMILIO

Sorry.

INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT

The three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.

MELISSA

It just seems so out of character. He was going to retire in two years.

ACE

Did he leave a note?

The elevator arrives.

EMILIO

No. That's nothing unusual. Some do, some don't. He didn't.

The elevator doors close.

INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Police are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of the officers.

EMILIO

Miss Robinson, this is officer Carlson.

CARLSON Evening, ma'am. I wonder if you could answer a few questions about the deceased?

Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.

NEIGHBOR

(to a cop)

I told you, I was across the hall in my apartment, I heard a scream. The door was locked, so I called the manager…

The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.

MANAGER

…The place was empty, except for the damn dog in the other room. Then I opened the balcony door, looked over the railing, and… splat, bang, pancake time…

Ace, continuing his investigation notices…

PODACTER'S DESK

in perfect order.

Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting out the noise.

INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.

ACE

Hey, fella, have a bad night?

Ace examines its paws.

Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.

Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.

EINHORN

Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

Emilio steps in immediately.

EMILIO

Ah, Lieutenant. He came with Miss Robinson –

EINHORN

This is official police business. We'll let you know if the coroner finds any ticks.

Cops snicker.

EMILIO

I just thought since Melissa –

ACE

E, forget it. She's right. Besides, I wouldn't want someone tracing my steps and pointing out all the mistakes I made.

Ace crosses to…

EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT

Ace examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.

EINHORN

Oh, so, you don't think this in an obvious suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

ACE

Well, I wouldn't say that. Lord knows, there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory, except of course that spot of blood on the balcony.

On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.

Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.

ACE

May I tell you what I think happened? Alrighty then!

Ace moves as he talks.

ACE

Roger Podacter went out after work. He had a few drinks, and he came home. But he wasn't alone. Someone was with him in this apartment. There was a struggle, and then Roger Podacter was thrown over that balcony. Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.

A beat as everyone considers this.

EINHORN

Well, that's a very entertaining story, but real detectives have to worry about that little thing lawyers call evidence.

Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.

ACE

Let's take a trip to clue corner, shall we? Can anyone tell me why a man buys a lottery ticket on the day he is going to commit suicide? Or why the family pet, suffering from acute canine trauma, clawed at the bedroom door until his paws bled? How about the blood on the railing? I'll bet if we put our thinking caps on we'll see that it was the result of the struggle that took place inside this apartment while Mr. Podacter was still alive!

(singing)

NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!

Everyone looks to Einhorn.

EINHORN

Not a bad try for a pet detective, but not near conclusive enough for us real investigators.

(beat)

First, people buy lottery tickets everyday. It's a habit. It doesn't prove a thing. Second, the dog wasn't suffering from canine trauma, he was suffering from bladder trauma. Sergeant Neilson found a piss stain as big as Lake Huron near the bed. And third, the blood on the railing. Simple. He doesn't jump far enough and whacks his head. A fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp, with traces of a white chalky substance. i.e. plaster from the balcony.

Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.

EINHORN

So much for your murder, Ventura.

AGUADO

Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet flush. Maybe someone lost their turtle?

Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.

ACE

Well, maybe I'm just a little out of my league, here. Einhorn…

Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.

ACE

…good work.

Ace and Melissa head for the door.

ACE

Oh, there is just one more thing, Lieutenant.

(re: the neighbor)

This man is Roger Podacter's neighbor. He lives across the hall. He said he heard a scream, is that right, sir?

The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.

ACE

And you said you had to open the balcony door when you keyed into the room?

MANAGER

That's right.

Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.

ACE

You're certain you had to open this door?

She nods.

EINHORN

What's the point, Ventura?

ACE

Only this… AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW…

Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.

ACE

(tapping the door)

This is double paned, sound- proofed glass. There's no way this neighbor could have heard Podacter scream on the way down with this door shut. The scream he heard came from inside this apartment, before Podacter was thrown over the railing! And the muderer closed the door before he left!

(celebrates insanely)

Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the demons!

(a la Poltergeist)

This house is clear.

INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ace drives straight ahead.

MELISSA

What are you thinking?

ACE

I'm thinking this whole thing is connected somehow.

(frustrated)

I'm thinking I want to find that other ring!

MELISSA

You checked all the rings.

ACE

I know, Pessimistress. Could anyone else have gotten a ring that year?

MELISSA

No. Camp was the only honoree. Just players and coaches. Everyone in the photo.

ACE

…Receipts! There must be receipts! You have a key to the office.

MELISSA

Ace this has been a really tough day. Can't we do this in the morning?

Ace looks at his watch.

ACE

Absolutely.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM

Ace's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.

INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

It's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.

MELISSA (O.S.)

These files go back to seventy- eight.

INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.

MELISSA

That was pretty impressive, what you did back at the apartment.

ACE

(still looking)

You don't have to tell me. I was there.

MELISSA

Maybe you should have joined the police force… become a real detective.

ACE

(shaking his head)

I don't do humans.

Melissa gets a bit closer.

MELISSA

You really love animals, don't you?

Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.

ACE

I feel a kinship with them. I understand them. Wanna hear something kinda spooky?

MELISSA

Sure.

She gets closer still.

ACE

One time, when I was about twelve, I had this dream that I was being followed by a dog with rabies. He had these really bloodshot eyes and foam coming out of his mouth… and just before I got to my front door… he jumped on me and sunk his teeth in. Then I woke up, and felt the back of my neck… check this out.

Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, barking like a vicious dog.

ACE

ARARAR!!!

Melissa jumps out of her skin.

MELISSA

Ohhh!! You bastard!

ACE

(snickering)

I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself. Are these all the receipts?

MELISSA

(mildly annoyed)

I don't know.

ACE

There's only a dozen of them here.

Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his mess.

MELISSA

(pointedly)

Gee… maybe they were misplaced because somebody didn't put the files back when he was…

ACE

Who the hell is that?

MELISSA

What…

Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a player.

ACE

That! Who the hell is that?!

He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.

MELISSA

Oh, that's Ray Finkle… the kicker. Don't you know who Ray Finkle is?

ACE

No! How come he's not in this picture?!

Melissa checks Ace's photo.

MELISSA

This was the picture you were using? This was taken earlier in the year. Finkle wasn't added to the roster till mid-season.

She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

He's the guy that missed the final field goal in the Super Bowl that year. Cost the Dolphins the game.

ACE

But he got a ring?

MELISSA

Definitely.

INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER

Ace and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots flash before them…

MELISSA

'Replacement Kicker Having Great Year'… 'Ready For Super Bowl, Confident Kicker Boasts'.

ACE

'Field Goal Sails Wide, Dolphins Lose Super Bowl'.

MELISSA

The kick heard round the world. That was Finkle. The Dolphins lost by one point.

Another headline hits the screen: FINKLE CONTRACT NOT RENEWED.

MELISSA

Poor guy.

ACE

Poor guy with a motive, baby. Where is he now?

MELISSA

Last I heard, he went back to his home town, Collier County. He used to work in a bar up there.

ACE

(pondering)

REHEHEALLY.

MELISSA

Can you drop me off before you go?

ACE

(shaking his head)

No way. It may not be safe at your apartment, and you shouldn't be left alone.

MELISSA

What do you suggest?

CUT TO:

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATER

We see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly.

SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY, as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking no prisoners.

CUT TO:

50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals.

Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure.

MELISSA

(totally amazed and exausted)

OH man… oh man! Oh wow!

ACE

(mock embarrassment)

I'm sorry… that's never happened to me before. I must be tired.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Various traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

A pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger.

Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.

DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks out.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Ace gets out of his car.

ACE

Excuse me, sir. Do you know where I can find the Pigskin Sports Bar?

FERN

Do I have a "kick me" sign on my back, son?

ACE

I wouldn't know anything about that, but if you could point me toward the bar.

Fern breaks down, sobbing.

FERN

They all left me… all of them!

ACE

Well… Hypothetically speaking, say they all left you and went to the Pigskin Sports Bar. How would they have gotten there from here?

FERN

Two miles down and take the first left.

ACE

Thanks very much! Take care now, 'bye 'bye then!

Ace gets into his car and pulls out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Fern enters, sits down at the desk, places the end of the shotgun in his mouth, reaches for the trigger and…

DING! Another car pulls up to the pump. Exasperated, he takes the gun out of his mouth.

FERN

(murmers to himself as he gets up)

Can't get anything done around here…

EXT. PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

A weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. Ace parks.

INT PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

If depression had a home, this is it. Several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts.

Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.

ACE

Excuse me, guy?! My name is Ace Ventura, I'm a pet detective. I'd like to ask you a few questions if I could.

No one even looks at him.

ACE

Just a few questions, that's all.

Still no one reacts.

ACE

(very up)

Who wants gum?!

Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.

ACE

I'm looking for a guy who used to work here.

The bartender takes the money.

BARTENDER

That right?

ACE

He was a kicker for the Dolphins. Ray Finkle.

A pool ball flies by Ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. All eyes are on Ace.

ACE

(to guy who threw it)

That would be a scratch.

TOOTHLESS GIANT

You a friend of Finkle's?

ACE

(thinks)

…Yes?

CRASH! The giant guy smashes his bottle.

ACE

Sorry, I have "say the opposite of what you mean" disease.

Several undesirables surround Ace.

TOOTHLESS GIANT

That bastard ruined this town.

ACE

Ewww… I hate that!

HICK #2

We bet everything we had on that Super Bowl and that son of a bitch gagged.

ACE

What a diiick!

They all move closer in a threatening manner.

HICK #3

Shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!

ACE

Death to Finkle! Death to Finkle!

The bartender steps in.

BARTENDER

We had a hell of a thing going here. Tourists coming to see Ray Finkle's home town. He was standing right over there when he got the call from the Dolphins.

The bartender points to a payphone. It has had the shit beaten out of it. Every expletive you can think of is graffitied around it.

ACE

Did he come back after the Super Bowl?

BARTENDER

Yeah… but the boys here had ways of letting him know he wasn't welcome.

HICK #1

Excuse me, I gotta take a wicked Finkle.

Laughter.

TOOTHLESS GIANT

What's the difference between Finkle and a jackass? A jackass can kick.

More laughter.

HICK #2

Why did Finkle cross the road?!

ACE

(facetious)

Wait… I know this one.

HICK #2

He didn't! And I've got the hair on my bumper to prove it!

Maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.

MOB

FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!

ACE

It's good you're dealing with the anger.

(beat)

I don't suppose anyone's seen him lately?

The chanting stops and the guys all look at Ace.

BARTENDER

No… but we know where his parents live! Don't we boys?!

HICK #1

Yeah! We sure do!

They all laugh insanely again.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.

ACE

…Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.

A gun slides out into Ace's face.

ACE

(with a gulp)

And a clean pair of shorts.

A deep gruff voice from inside.

VOICE

What do you know about Ray Finkle?

ACE

Southpaw soccer style kicker. Graduated from Collier High in June, 1976. Stetson University honors graduate, class of 1980. Holds two NCAA division one records. One for most points in a season, one for distance. Former nickname The Mule. The first and only pro athlete ever to come out of Collier County. And one helluva model American.

After a beat the peephole closes. The door slowly creaks open revealing MR. FINKLE, an unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun.

MR. FINKLE

Are you another one of them scumbags from 'Hard Copy'?

ACE

No, sir. I'm just a very big Finkle fan. This is my Graceland, sir.

Mrs. Finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over.

MRS. FINKLE

Will you put that gun down. The boy's a fan of our son. So nice to meet you. I'm Ray's mother, and this is Ray's father.

INT. FINKLE HOUSE - DAY

ACE

It's a real honor.

MRS. FINKLE

My Ray is so appreciative of his fans. He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

ACE

Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

MRS. FINKLE

Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

Ace is surprised.

MRS. FINKLE

Would you like some cookies? I just baked them.

Mrs. Finkle hurries off to the kitchen. Ace smiles at Mr. Finkle. The guy's a corpse.

ACE

Wow… Ray Finkle's house! Can't wait to meet him!

MR. FINKLE

Ray ain't comin' home.

ACE

But your wife said you expect him home any minute.

MR. FINKLE

She expects him home any minute.

He points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen.

MR. FINKLE

Engines runnin but there's no one behind the wheel. Ten years ago our son escaped from Shady Acres Psychiatric Hospital in Tampa. They're still buggin' us to pick up his stuff.

Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.

MRS. FINKLE

(sweetly)

It was all that Dan Marino's fault, everyone knows that. If he had held the ball laces out, like you're supposed to, Ray would never have missed that kick. Dan Marino should die of Gonorrhea and rot in Hell. Would you like a cookie, son?

Ace takes a cookie. Holding it up.

ACE

Hey, what do ya know. They're little footballs.

MRS. FINKLE

Laces OUT!

CRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window. Outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken patrons from the Pigskin Sports Bar drives by yelling their Finkle chant.

MOB

FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!…

MRS. FINKLE

I told you he had a lot of fans.

Mrs. Finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. It hits one of the vandals, knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away.

MR. FINKLE

(aside to Ace)

She got the arm. The boy got the leg.

INT. HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Mrs. Finkle and Ace are walking down the hallway to Ray's room.

MRS. FINKLE

When Ray gets back and starts kicking again, he'll never even know he was gone. I kept his room just the way he left it.

She opens the door to Ray's room. Ace steps in.

INT. RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: "Death to Marino!", Marino must die!!!, etc.

ACE

…Oooh boy.

MRS. FINKLE

What a sports nut, huh?

In the center of the room is a movie projector.

ACE

May I?

MRS. FINKLE

Oh yes. By all means.

Mrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector.

The film flickers over the "Marino must die!!!" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. Marino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. The film repeats itself ad infinitum.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

Ace on the payphone. We see the gas station in the background.

ACE

Melissa, it's Ace.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

MELISSA

Ace? Where are you?

INTERCUT ACE/MELISSA

ACE

I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's the Mayor. Where's Dan Marino?

MELISSA

Marino? Why?

ACE

Because he's about to join Snowflake. I gotta know where he is.

MELISSA

Okay, hold on…

Melissa checks Marino's itinerary. Ace waits, impatiently.

ACE

(to himself)

Come on. Come on…

In the background, we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a gurney. The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot. We widen to see them load good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away, ringing the station bell one more time. Ace doesn't notice.

MELISSA

Ah, he had practice. Then… he has a commercial shoot out at the Prescott Sound Stage.

ACE

Where is that?

MELISSA

It's on Route One by the Six Cut Off. Thirty minutes outside of town.

ACE

Okay, that's about fifteen miles from me. Call the police. Get extra security over there now.

MELISSA

Ace, tell me what's going on.

(beat)

Ace?…

The payphone dangles off the hook. Ace is…

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

…in his car racing out of the swampland, his heaad now back out the window so he can see. He leaves a faded, old, barely legible sign in his wake: "

WELCOME TO COLLIER COUNTY. HOME OF RAY FINKLE"

The "F" in "FINKLE" has been replaced with "ST" in spray paint.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIOS - DAY

Rehearsal for an Isotoner ad in progress.

MARINO

…So I protect the hands that protect me. With Isotoners.

Marino gets carted off by FIVE HUGE LINEMEN.

DIRECTOR

Good. Remember, exit camera right. That's to your left. Alright, let's get ready to shoot this.

FIRST A.D.

(to the linemen)

Helmets on this time!

The linemen disperse.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIO - DAY

Marino is in the make-up chair.

MARINO

(to make-up girl)

See, in 82 we just choked. We had a chance to win it and we didn't –

DIRECTOR

Dan, are you ready?

MARINO

Ah, sure.

(to girl)

I'll tell you later.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

The cops race onto the lot.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

Marino takes center stage.

A.D. Quiet on the set… roll… speed…

DIRECTOR

…And action!

MARINO

Hi, I'm Dan Marino. If anyone knows the value of protection, it's me…

We see an old clip of Marino getting sacked.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

Cops scramble on foot to the sound stage.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

The commercial is winding up. The linemen ready themselves.

MARINO

…So I protect the hands that protect me. With Isotoners.

The five linemen grab Marino and run off camera.

DIRECTOR

And cut! That was good. Again from one.

But two of the linemen keep running with Marino…

DIRECTOR

I said cut!!

…And they keep running.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

What the hell are they doing?

…Right out the studio door. Then the cops arrive and race after them. Two linemen stumble out of the dressing room holding their heads.

EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY

Ace skids around a corner, looking way up ahead.

He sees Marino being shoved into a black 81 Ford Bronco. They drive off.

The cops come out of the building on foot. Too late.

Ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down.

ACE

(yelling at cops)

S'cuse meee! Pet Detective!

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace's head is out the driver's window through the entire chase. As he starts gaining on the bad guys, they start shooting. Ace wisely puts his head inside the car.

ACE'S POV

He can't see shit through his broken windshield.

He pokes his head out again. They shoot again.

Ace swerves off the road into…

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace's car smashes through benches and tables. Then it flips over a few times and lands on its wheels with a horrid SMASH. Ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious.

Ace's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him. Ace cracks his eyes and sees the bird. Then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all about Marino.

ACE

I did it! I did it! I caught the white pigeon! I caught the white pigeon!

Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his head. He looks insane.

ACE (CONT'D)

(singing)

I caught the white pigeon, I caught the white pigeon, I caught the white…

Ace slows down and begins to look around warily. There are now an unusual number of birds perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings.

The sky grows darker. He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight.

Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, and gouging, and ripping his flesh.

Now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm. Twenty others are trying to take Ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing…

ACE

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window. A small boy is pulling it.

BOY

Hey mister. Hey mister.

Ace come to suddenly, and looks at the boy with a crazed expression.

BOY (CONT'D)

That was a really neat crash, mister. Do it again!

Ace sighs with relief.

EXT. MIAMI - DAY

Various headlines hit the news stands: "MARINO KIDNAPPED" "STAR QB MISSING" "DAN WHERE ARE YOU?"

THE GLOBE HEADLINE: "MARINO ABDUCTED BY ALIEN FRANCHISE!" On the cover, Marino stands with several Space Aliens in football gear.

EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY

A chaotic press conference. Zillions of REPORTERS shout all kinds of questions at Einhorn.

REPORTER

Lieutenant, have there been any ransom demands?

EINHORN

There's been no communication with the kidnappers at this time.

REPORTER #2

What's going to happen to the Super Bowl? Will it be postponed?

EINHORN

As of now, the game is going on as scheduled.

REPORTER #3

Why wasn't the public told about Snowflake's kidnapping?

EINHORN

Secrecy was essential. We didn't want any public interference.

REPORTER

Are the crimes related? And what about Roger Podacter's murder?

EINHORN

I'm sorry. I can't comment any further. Now if you'll excuse me.

Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters.

INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office.

EINHORN

Emilio, get me the autopsy on Podacter! Aguado, send out a memo. No one talks to the press…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

EINHORN

…And somebody get me a cup of coffee!

ACE

(TV announcer's voice)

Tonight on "MIAMI VICE", Crockett geets the boss coffee!

Ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. Einhorn walks to her private bathroom.

EINHORN

Ventura, when I get out of this bathroom, you better be gone.

ACE

Is it number one or number two?

Einhorn turns and glares at Ace.

ACE

I just want to know how much time I have.

Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.

ACE

Oh, by the way, I went ahead and solved that pesky, Snowflake/Podacter/Marino thing.

EINHORN (O.S.)

(humoring him)

Oh yeah?

ACE

yeah, ever hear of a former Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

The water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner.

EINHORN

Alright, Ventura. Make it quick.

ACE

I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank. It's from a Dolphin '82 AFC Championship ring. It would have been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray Finkle missed the big kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. We're talking paranoid, delusional psychosis. I saw the guy's room… Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lector.

EINHORN

So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

ACE

My guess is Finkle was snooping around. Podacter recognized him. End of story. As for Snowflake… they gave him Finkle's number, and taught him how to kick a field goal. Finkle took it personally.

Einhorn listens with great interest.

EINHORN

So where is Finkle, now?

ACE

He broke out of a metal hospital. Did a Claude Raines. He's been planning his revenge for years. Waiting for the perfect time to get back at the Dolphins. The time when it would hurt them the most. Super Bowl time! Man, I'm tired of being right!

Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. She's totally softened her demeanor.

EINHORN

Congratulations. You've done some fine detective work, Ace.

ACE

Ahh, could you talk in my good ear. I thought I heard you call me Ace.

Einhorn gets real close.

EINHORN

Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR, TONSIL CLEANING, OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON ACE. Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.

ACE

Your gun's digging into my hip.

More kissing, the Ace stops.

EINHORN

(still coming on)

What's wrong, Ace? Want me to read you your rights?

ACE

Maybe later.

EINHORN

What is it? That bony little bitch, Melissa Robinson?

ACE

(defensive)

No. You just don't do anything for me.

He quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.

EINHORN

I'll be here if you ever want a real woman.

There's a sharp KNOCK at the door.

EINHORN

What is it?

Aguado opens the door.

AGUADO

Everything okay in here? Heard some commotion.

EINHORN

Fine, Sergeant.

AGUADO

You want me to throw him out?

EINHORN

Why don't you throw yourself out.

AGUADO

…Yes, ma'am.

A crestfallen Aguado exits. Ace heads for the door.

EINHORN

Ace, I want you to leave everything to us.

ACE

Can't do that, Lieutenant. I was hired to find Snowflake.

EINHORN

When we find Marino, We'll deliver Snowflake.

ACE

When I find Snowflake, I'll deliver Marino.

He exits.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. Kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. The same Burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.

ACE

(shouting)

Nice to see you again!

The Burnout just keeps thrashing. Ace spots Woodstock watching the band and joins him.

WOODSTOCK

St. Francis, how's it goin'?

ACE

(kidding)

That's none of your damn business.

WOODSTOCK

Isn't it?

ACE

Is it?

WOODSTOCK

Anything new on that dolphin?

ACE

Got his picture on some tuna cans, but nothing so far.

A singer ROARS on stage. He sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.

SINGER Arroohhghhh! Myrrrooohghhhh! Geroooghhh!

WOODSTOCK

So, what can I do for you today?

ACE

I need info on a football flunky named Ray Finkle.

WOODSTOCK

Sorry, Ace, I can't help you right now. I gotta watch this band! They are the shit!

ACE

Are they?

WOODSTOCK

Aren't they?

ACE

Alright then. Don't worry about it. I mean dolphins aren't exactly an endangered species. It's not like the whole food chain's gonna be affected if one highly intelligent mammal dies a slow and painful death! Hell, if the band is loud enough, you won't even hear its pitiful whimpering!!

Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Woodstock is at his computer. Ace looks over his shoulder. Finkle's Social Security information appears on the screen.

WOODSTOCK

This guy's last reported income was September, 1982.

ACE

Well then. We know he's incredibly thrifty.

WOODSTOCK

Is he?

ACE

Isn't he?

Woodstock types in more information. Finkle's TRW flashes on the screen.

WOODSTOCK

Well, I think we can be pretty sure he's involved in the kidnapping of the dolphin.

ACE

Really? What makes you say that?

WOODSTOCK

There's two-thousand dollars worth of smelts on his VISA card.

After a beat Ace realizes it was a bad joke.

ACE

Please yank me no further. I beg of you.

WOODSTOCK

Alright already. The last time this guy used his credit card was June, '84. He rented a car from Avis. And… eww… he was a bad boy. They found it abandoned two months later in South Miami.

ACE

Anything else?

WOODSTOCK

Nope.

ACE

Well… you did all you could. Thanks for nothin.

WOODSTOCK

Hey man, according to this, your friend Ray Finkle doesn't exist.

ACE

Hmm, I know what that's like.

WOODSTOCK

Do you?

ACE

Don't I?

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace emerges from the basement. The band is between songs. Ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped.

ACE

(to burnout)

Did you get all the spiders outta there?

Ace heads out, then freezes. The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit. Then they see Ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats.

Suddenly the music starts. The burnout's head wails again. His manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for Ace to bolt.

One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace.

BURNOUT

(calling, as he gets up)

Thanks, man! You're a great dancer!

Ace pushes his way through the crowd. The thugs follow.

Ace nears the stage. It's wild. People are diving off and getting moshed.

Before the thugs grab him, Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. The insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads.

The thugs exchange a look, then dive after Ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues.

Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. The singer is lying there exhausted. Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor.

ACE

(screams)

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, SPANK ME MOMMY!!!

The audience looks at Ace for a second. Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!!

It's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions.

ACE

URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW!

The crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time.

Ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other.

The thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them.

When the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air. The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. They're out cold.

EXT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace's car PEELS OUT and races by the parked '81 Ford Bronco.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace's car skids to a halt. He hops out.

INT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There's a loud BANGING at the door. Melissa awakens, looks at the clock: 3:32 a.m. She drags herself to the door.

MELISSA

Who is it?

ACE (O.S.)

Ira.

MELISSA

Ira who?

ACE (O.S.)

I refuse to do a 'knock knock joke'. Come on, open up!

Melissa opens the door.

MELISSA

Ace, what are you doing? It's the middle of the night!

ACE

You have to commit me.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

Ace's clunker speeds down the highway.

ACE (V.O.)

Finkle escaped from Shady Acres in Tampa. They still have some of his stuff.

MELISSA (V.O.)

So you think they're going to let us just waltz in and look around?

EXT. SHADY ACRES - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A state hospital located on acres of green, manicured lawns.

INT. SHADY ACRES - DAY

The reception area. A DOCTOR is before Melissa.

DOCTOR

Mrs. Robinson? I'm Doctor Handly. Now who is it that you'd like to have us look at?

MELISSA

My brother… Eugene.

ANGLE ON ACE - Looking like the football player who never wore a helmet.

ACE

I'm ready to go in, Coach. Just give me a chance. I know there's a lot riding on it, but it's all psychological. Got to stay in a positive frame of mind. Memorize the play book. Study the films.

Ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes, with a crazed look on his face.

ACE (CON'T)

I'm gonna execute a button-hook pattern!

He begins to make a play in slow motion.

ACE (CON'T)

Super slo-mo!

CUT TO:

EXT. SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY

Melissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.

DOCTOR

You're brother won't be the first professional football player we've treated.

MELISSA

Is that right?

DOCTOR

Yes. We're very sensitive to the emotional stress athletes have to endure.

Ace runs across the b.g. screaming "I'm open! I'm open!"

DOCTOR

We'll have to do some preliminary evaluations, but I think your brother will fit in nicely here.

MELISSA

That's a relief, Doctor.

Ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the doctor stop to watch him.

DOCTOR

He seems to have some difficulty letting go of the game. Has he had a long history of mental illness?

MELISSA

(truthfully)

As long as I've known him.

Ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.

INT. SHADY GLADE ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

The doctor is showing Melissa around. Ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary shoulder pads.

DOCTOR

This is our therapy room… Arts and crafts…

They turn a corner. Ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats.

DOCTOR (CON'T)

That's the storage room. This hallway leads to another recreational area –

Ace WHISTLES loudly and gestures like a referee…

ACE

HALFTIIIIME!!

Ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room.

MELISSA

He'll be fine by himself for the next twenty minutes.

DOCTOR

Well, why don't I show you the dormitories, then?

They leave Ace.

After a beat, Ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Cartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE.

Ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the jackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded Isotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. "Laces Out!" is insanely scrawled on every page.

Ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:

SEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER

ACE

(reading)

A massive search ended today when rescue workers were unable to find the body of Lois Einhorn…

(stunned)

…a camper reported lost since Friday…

(to himself)

Lois Einhorn… holy shit balls.

Ace sits bewildered.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The phone rings at Emilio's desk. He answers it.

EMILIO

Echavez.

INT. SHADY ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

Ace is on the phone. A CRAZY GUY is hovering nearby.

ACE

This is Chicken Little. The sky is falling.

EMILIO

What?

BACK TO EMILIO

A beat as he listens to Ace's news.

EMILIO

I don't get it. What's it mean?

INTERCUT ACE/EMILIO

ACE

It means she's involved in this. The article's dated the day before Finkle disappeared.

EMILIO

Before who disappeared?

ACE

Finkle. Ray Finkle… the guy who took the dolphin? The guy you're supposed to be looking for?! Einhorn didn't tell you, did she?

EMILIO

Hey, Ace. I see where you're goin' with this and you're goin' alone.

A Crazy Guy stands next to Ace now and begins mimicking everything he says.

ACE

Come on, E. I tell her about Finkle, she doesn't tell a soul. I have an article here that connects her with Finkle. You gotta' check her out.

(to Crazy Guy mimicking)

Do you mind?

The Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones.

EMILIO

Ace, I like my job. I get health insurance and benefits.

CRAZY GUY

(into receiver)

I'm the Lindberg Baby. Come and get me.

ACE

Emilio, Einhorn is involved. You're gonna' have to make a decision here.

(beat)

Listen, I gotta get off the phone. I think I just solved the Lindberg case.

Melissa and the Doctor return.

DOCTOR

Well, look who's trying to use the phone.

Ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.

ACE

Brian Piccalo is dead.

Ace breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.

We hear a thrash version of the theme to "Brian's Song" as they exit the hospital.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Emilio stands at a window, watching Einhorn drive off. The coast is clear so he sneaks into…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He rifles through her file cabinet. He tears through papers. Then he looks in her desk.

Stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note: We can make out the signature. Roger. He pockets it and walks out.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa pull up in the old heap.

ACE

Good job today. You're quite a dirty rotten filthy liar.

MELISSA

(flattered)

Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to stay here with me?

ACE

Naw, I got some thinking to do. Besides, you'd be safer with Salman Rushdie

MELISSA

Okay.

She gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window.

MELISSA

Listen… I know there isn't much time left. The game is tomorrow. But I know you've done your best. It's just an impossible situation. I don't expect..

ACE

Hey…

Ace leans over and kisses her.

ACE (CONT'D)

…bet on the Dolphins.

INT. ACE'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE UP: ANSWERING MACHINE

Wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button.

MESSAGE #1

(Shickadance rasp)

Venturaaaa? Your time is up! You're out! You hear me?! No rent… no roof!

We widen to find Ace on the couch listening.

MESSAGE #2

Ace, it's E. Got something you might find interesting. It's a note from Podacter to Einhorn, thanking her for a wonderful Saturday night. This is too weird, man?

ACE

Wiggles, rewind.

Wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, and holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval.

ACE

What the hell does Lois Einhorn have to do with Ray Finkle? Come on, think!

DISSOLVE TO:

Later. Ace is posed like Rodin's "The Thinker".

ACE

Finkle and Einhorn. In it together. How? Why?

A small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace.

DISSOLVE TO:

Later still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.

ACE

Alright! Here we go! Answer's right there! Just gotta get some blood to the brain! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

The animals all watch him like he's crazy.

DISSOLVE TO:

Daybreak. Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the verge of tears.

ACE

(whimpering)

Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn and Finkle.

He turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.

ACE

(to sleeping monkey)

Quitter.

Wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him.

ACE

What do you want? Huh?

Wiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice.

ACE (CONT'D)

What? I got no food for you. You gotta have money to buy food. I gotta find the dolphin to get the money. I don't see any dolphins around here, do you? Face it, it's hopeless… your master is a LOSER.

Ace buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again.

ACE

LOO… HOO…

Suddenly he is silenced by something amazing.

Wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair over the head shot. The "make-over" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!!

ACE

Oh, my god! That's it!

He jumps up, estatic.

ACE

Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is Einhorn!… Einhorn is a man!!!

Ace's expression quickly turns sour.

ACE

OH MY GOD!!! EINHORN IS A MAN!!!

MUSIC UP: AEROSMITH'S DUD LOOKS LIKE A LADY…

Ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom.

INT. ACE'S BATHROOM - MORNING - QUICK CUTS

…Ace furiously brushes his teeth.

…Ace rinses with mouthwash, spits it out and gags.

…Ace is in the shower. He slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression of horror on his face.

INT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE UP:

A woman's leg being shaved.

Woman sexily putting on nylons.

Woman hands squeezing perfume bulb.

Woman's hand putting on AFC championship ring. One stone is missing.

EXT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches Einhorn's house from his car.

ACE

(remembering)

You're gun is sticking into my hip. Yeeeekkkk!

Einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car. Ace shudders once more and then follows her.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

The road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the opposite direction. Out of town. Ace tails her at a safe distance, with his head out the window, of course.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Various shots of crazy fans, piling into the stadium.

INT. STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

Melissa, BOBBY RIDDLE, and GUESTS all amidst the usual pre-game hobnobbing. Most of the talk centers on the loss of Marino.

Emilio, in full uniform, and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Einhorn drives south out of town. The area's getting remote. Ace follows.

Einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to…

EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

A large, abandoned industrial facility. Einhorn parks, disappears inside…

A few beats later, Ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "Mission Impossible".

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons.

Ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he hears a familiar voice.

JOHN MADDEN (O.S.)

I particularly like the match-ups of the defense.

Ace sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game show. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)

…But the real story of this game is the absence of Dan Marino. Him being kidnapped and all has got to be a strain on this Miami team. I really feel sorry for those guys! I mean, it's hard enough enduring the pressure of the Super Bowl, without your star quarterback gettin' himself kidnapped. This is the whole ball of wax, folks! You wanna' get kidnapped, you do it in the off season!…

Marino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake "watches" from a ground level cistern serving as an ad hoc tank.

Ace sneaks closer.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

The crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem.

Various shots of fans all standing at attention.

In the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Einhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. The thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention.

The song ends. The crowd cheers.

In a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now.

EINHORN

I just love Super Bowl Sunday, don't you, Dan? A magical afternoon where dreams are made… or crushed!

DAN

Look lady, if you want tickets, you're going about it in the wrong way.

EINHORN

Do I look familiar to you, Dan? Does it seem as if we've met someplace before?

DAN

I don't know… I get hit in the head a lot!

On the TV the ref makes an announcement.

REF It's tails. The Eagles will receive.

Dan really struggles now.

EINHORN

Oops. Looks like we're going to have to kick, Dan.

Einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she boots a ball through a window of the warehouse.

Marino doesn't know what to think.

EINHORN

I made some refreshments, Dan. Would you like some refreshments, Dan? I'll be right back, Daaaan!!

She goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail.

MARINO

Look, I don't know how much psycho woman is paying you guys, but I can double it.

VINNIE

Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho woman keeps us out of prison.

Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football.

ROC Hey, Marino, check it out. I'm throwin' passes to a Dolphin!

He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically.

Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are furious.

VINNIE

Get some more fish!

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.

ROC Where the hell's the smelts?

He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar "Pop" of a sunflower seed being cracked open.

Roc's eyes widen. He turns and sees…

Ace coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks Roc in the head with a pail full of fish.

ACE

(doing Brando)

He sleeps with the fishes.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS

VINNIE

Hey Roc, what the hell was that?

Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground.

He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.

Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.

VINNIE

Hey man! What happened? What's goin on…?

We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a chain from the ceiling.

ACE

Guess what, boys, it's nap time.

Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off.

Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.

CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED

ACE

Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I didn't mean to - Oh man!!!

Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.

ACE

(looking to God)

Lord, I swear! I just wanted to knock them out!

Ace abruptly stops to think.

ACE

Is that murder? I don't know. They were gonna kill me. But they didn't… But they tried. That's self defense. That's it!! I have nothing to worry about!!

CUT TO:

Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY

Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to untie him.

MARINO

(whispers)

Who are you?

ACE

(whispers)

Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I've been sent in with a special play.

(whispers)

Quarterback sneak.

WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN.

EINHORN (O.S.)

Penalty. Too many men on the field.

Ace turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank.

EINHORN (CON'T)

I warned you, Ventura.

ACE

What happened to "Ace"?

EINHORN

Good question.

She pulls out a cellular phone and dials.

ACE

Be careful with that phone, lieutenant. I wouldn't want you to get a tumor.

EINHORN

(into phone)

Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn. Get some men over to the old ironworks factory on Victoria Road. I've got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse. It's Ace Ventura. He's killed Marino and Snowflake.

Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away.

EINHORN

Vinnie! Roc! Get in here!

Ace gets a very guilty look.

ACE

What? Who are they? You mean there's other people here?

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear…

RADIO DISPATCHER

(V.O.)

Attention all units. Code 11 in progress at 343 Victorville Road. Officer needs back-up…

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

The cops and Emilio listen to their ear pieces…

RADIO DISPATCHER

(V.O.)

…Suspect's name: Ace Ventura, male Caucasian, he is armed and dangerous…

Emilio nudges Melissa.

EMILIO

It's Ace. Let's go.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Emilio high tails it out of there. Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc… Melissa runs behind, trying to catch up.

MELISSA

Emilio, is he in trouble?

EMILIO

Don't worry, there's nothing Ace can't handle!

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY

Einhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck.

ACE

Don't kill meeee!! Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'll never tell anyone! I swear!

(indicating Marino)

He's the one you want!! Kill him!!

MARINO

(indicating Ace)

No… kill him!

The two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.

EINHORN

No, I'm gonna kill the dolphin first.

(to Ace)

I wouldn't want you to miss that.

Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!

We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.

Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!

ACE

Blue forty-two!!

Einhorn turns to Ace.

EINHORN

SHUT UP!!

ACE

BLUE FORTY-TWO!

Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.

ACE

HUT! HUT!

Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.

ACE

(smug)

Yes. The highly trained dolphin. Perhaps the smartest mammal in the animal kingdom. See how he knew exactly what I wanted him to do, as if our minds were somehow in complete synchronization. They have been know to save men at sea you know. They have their own language.

(to Snowflake)

Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake! Bring me the gun!

(makes dolphin sounds)

EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!

Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.

ACE

(under his breath)

Stupid fish.

ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.

JOHN MADDEN

He got all of his leg into that one!

The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.

ACE

Good to see someone who doesn't buckle under the pressure?

MARINO

Yeah, not like in 82 when we choked…

Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head.

EINHORN

What would you know about pressure?

ACE

Well, I've kissed a man.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)

Of course, there's never been a more crucial kick than the famous Kick heard 'round the world…

The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.

JOHN MADDEN

…I mean, it's clear to me that it was a good hold. Finkle just booted it.

EINHORN

The laces weren't out. THE LACES WEREN'T OUT!!

Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand.

A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach.

Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.

Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her.

They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the while trying to get free.

Einhorn kicks Ace. He flies into Marino.

MARINO

Having a little trouble with the lady, Ace?

ACE

(out of breath)

You don't understand, she's a –

Einhorn grabs Ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face.

Meanwhile, cops start arriving, SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.

More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.

AGUADO

(caught up)

Get him, Lois!

Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.

EINHORN

(screaming)

Shoot him! Shoot him!

We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.

A loud voice comes from off camera.

EMILIO

DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!

Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.

MELISSA

Put down your guns or this cop gets it!

The SWAT team hesitates.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

I mean it!!

Much to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.

EMILIO

(whispers to Melissa)

Ah… Melissa? That's a hair trigger.

(loud to cops)

She's not joking!

The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.

EINHORN

He kidnapped Snowflake. He killed Roger Podacter, and he was about to kill Dan Marino and me!

ACE

Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! But I find the reference section much more enlightening.

(doing his best Clarence Darrow)

For instance, if you were to look up 'professional football's all time bonehead plays', you might read about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle, who missed a twenty-six yard field goal in the closing seconds of Super Bowl Seventeen.

(in one breath)

What you wouldn't read about is how Ray Finkle lost his mind, and was committed to a mental institute, only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hker, seducing her way to the top, in a diabolical plan to get even with Dan Marino whom he blamed for the entire thing!!!

Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.

AGUADO

What the hell are you trying to say?

ACE

She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

EINHORN

He's lying! Shoot him!

Ace walks over to her.

ACE

Let's just see who's lying. Would a real woman have to wear one of these?

Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is real. Ace keeps tugging it.

The SWAT team ready themselves.

ACE (CONT'D)

Boy, that's really on there! But tell me this: Would a real woman be missing these?!

Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.

The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.

ACE

Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery can be done over the weekend! But I doubt if she could find the time during her busy schedule to get rid of Mr. Knish!!

Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect figure of a woman.

ACE

Oooh boy.

Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.

MARINO

Psst… Ace. Come here.

ACE

(to everyone)

Could you excuse me just a second.

Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.

EINHORN

Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!

MELISSA

(to cops)

Don't anybody make a move!

Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the crowd.

ACE

Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed colleague Mr. Marino, has just brought some new evidence to my attention. Now, history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal minds can be wrong, from time to time. But, if I have been mistaken… if the lieutenant is indeed a woman… then my friends, she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!!!

Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)

Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.

FINKLE

(deepest voice possible)

It was Marino's fault. The laces were in.

(breaking down now)

They were IN!!!

Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.

Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his spout.

Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.

ACE

Somebody read it its rights.

Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.

FINKLE

DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!

Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.

FINKLE

(gasping for air)

Help I can't swim!!!

Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.

Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.

Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a perfect fit.

ACE

LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR HERR!!!

Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.

EMILIO

Melissa… you can give me back my gun now.

Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.

Now Aguado appears beside Ace.

AGUADO

I don't know how you did it, Ventura… but that was damn good police work. Alright guys, let's wrap this up!

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for…

…Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.

HIGH ANGLE

The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire right in the middle.

MARINO (O.S.)

hey Ace?

ACE (O.S.)

Yeah, Dan?

MARINO (O.S.)

Got any more gum?

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM - DAY

The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the awesome spectacle.

Some fireworks go off around the tank. A marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami Dolphins are proud to welcome back to BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our beloved mascot and star of the halftime show…

ANGLE ON

The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Snowflake!!

As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing spectacular flips, they kiss.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.

Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.

ACE

You idiot! Do you know what you've done?!

The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.

MASCOT

Huh?

Ace grabs him.

ACE

You just cost me ten thousand bucks, Polly!

MASCOT

Yeah Blow me.

ACE

REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!

PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot of finger pointing.

Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.

The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.

ANNOUNCER

The National Football League would now like to offer a special thank you to the man who rescued Dan Marino and our beloved Snowflake…

On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

A great humanitarian, and lover of all animals… Mr. Ace Ventura!

Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.

The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he looks into camera with his fist raised.

MUSIC UP: THRASH METAL

STRIKER
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow

ELAINE
I won't be back. I've requested the
Atlanta run.

STRIKER
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really
can change.

ELAINE
Then why don't you take the job that Louie
Netz offered you at Boeing?

In the b.g. an airline PORTER is transporting an ELDERLY
COUPLE in an electric cart. They round the corner too fast
and the woman falls out. Husband doesn't notice.

STRIKER
You know I haven't been able to get near
an airplane since the war. And even if I
could, they wouldn't hire me because of my
war record.

ELAINE
Your war record? You're the only one
keeping that alive. For everyone else it's
ancient history.

STRIKER
You expect me to believe that?

In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is
immediately run over by another electric cart.

ELAINE
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war. Different
cities, different jobs, and not one of
them shows you can accept any real
responsibility.

STRIKER
But if you'll just give me...

ELAINE
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to
Chicago, I'm going to start my life all
over again. I'm sorry.

She walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with
determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on
his lapel.

ZEALOT #3
Hello, we'd like you to have this...

Without looking, Striker decks the Zealot with one punch. He
walks after Elaine.

TEXACO SERVICE MAN is cleaning windshield.

OVEUR
Unlikely, Victor. I just reviewed the Area

That's an occluded front stalled over the
Dakotas -- backed up all the way to Utah.

Texaco Service Man opens hood and checks dipstick.

BASTA
If it decides to push over into the Great

OVEUR
I double checked the terminal forecast and
winds aloft. IFR ceilings all the way.

Oveur gives charge card to Texaco Man.

BASTA

OVEUR
Well, there's some light scattered cover

Denver is still the best bet.

Oveur signs charge form and gives it to Texaco Man.

OVEUR

Elaine turns and is shocked to see Striker approaching his

You...you shouldn't have come. I don't
have time now.

Oh, stewardess...

Excuse me.

Striker sits down.

MRS. ELDERLY
No wonder you're upset. She's lovely. And
a darling figure. Supple, pouting breasts.
Firm thighs. It's a shame you're not

I remember when we first met. It was

MURDOCK
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me
confused with someone else. My name is

MURDOCK
Ah, Victor, why don't you get the
coordinates on the altitude vector and
find out the ratio of direct velocity over
engine speed?

Victor is puzzled.

JOEY
You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My

OVEUR
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him

All right. But just remember, my name is

He points to his nametag.

MURDOCK
I'm an airline pilot.

Ah, Clarence, according to my

Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks
to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking
instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers
angrily.

we'd watch until the sun came up. When it
did, it was almost like...like each new

Oh, I'd love to.

RANDY
Okay, this is one of my favorites.

Randy is sitting on the edge of the gurney as she strums
three opening chords.

RANDY
(strumming and singing in
ballad tempo)
'I've traveled the banks of the River
Jordan, to find where it flows to the
sea.'

Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer
around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers
upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME.

RANDY
'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the
hungry and saw that I was looking at me.'

As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other
with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the
Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling
sweetly at each other.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Murdock and Oveur smile sweetly at each other...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

RANDY
(singing and playing the
guitar)
'And I wanted to know if life had a
purpose, and what it all means in the end.
In the silence I listened to the voices
inside me, and they told me again and
again.'

Tempo Jumps to rock pace.

RANDY
'There is only one river. There is only
one sea.'

Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar,
knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V.
squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollow苞heeked. No one else
notices.

RANDY
'And it flows through you, and it flows
through me. There is only one people, we
are one and the same.'

Lisa manages to reconnect her I.V.

RANDY
(still singing)
'We are all one spirit, one name. We are
the Father, we are the son.'

Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the
passengers start to get into the music.

RANDY
'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.'

Mrs. Davis rushes to reconnect Lisa's I.V. Lisa doesn't
react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest.

RANDY & PASSENGERS
'We are only one people, we are one and
the same.'

As Lisa revives, Randy swings her guitar and clonks Mrs.
Davis on the head.

RANDY & PASSENGERS
'We are all one spirit on Earth, one
name.'

Elaine enters with dinners.

OVEUR
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little
bit late tonight.

ELAINE
Who wants to be first?

MURDOCK
Go ahead, Clarence, I got it.

Oveur removes his headset, Elaine puts tray down.

ELAINE
How's the weather?

MURDOCK
Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff
ahead of us. It might get rough again
unless we can climb on top. But our
airspeed is holding steady at six hundred
ten knots.

ELAINE
That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen
asked me if you would autograph this
basketball.

Murdock autographs it reluctantly.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT

A JAPANESE GENERAL, dressed in World War II uniform, is now
seated next to Striker.

STRIKER
After the war, I just wanted to get as far
away from things as possible. So Elaine
and I joined the Peace Corps. We were
assigned to an isolated tribe, the
Molombos.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY

Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by
two GUARDS. We hear Jungle Animal SOUNDS. The chief is
standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN
who are making the jungle animal sounds.

STRIKER (v.o.)
They had never seen Americans before.

When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands
and the sounds stop.

STRIKER (v.o.)
At first, they didn't know what to think
of us; but soon we gained their trust.

The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake.
Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased,
Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker.

STRIKER (v.o.)
It really was a challenge during the year
introducing them to our Western culture.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. JUNGLE - ANOTHER AREA - DAY

Elaine is having a Supperware party for native women.

ELAINE
Also, Supperware products are ideal for
storing leftovers to help stretch your
food dollar. This two quart "Seals-M-Rite"
container with a special "Close-M-Tite"
lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and
prevents sugared cereals from sticking.

She scoops a ladle of corn mush from a carved wooden bowl
into a Supperware container.

ELAINE
Meat and dairy products are protected
against unwanted refrigerator odors when
sealed in this non-slip pastel colored
"Freez-o-leer".

When she burps the lid, the Supperware makes a human burp
SOUND.

EXT. JUNGLE - ANOTHER AREA - DAY

Striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree.

STRIKER (v.o.)
You must understand that these people had
been completely isolated from
civilization.

Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He
misses.

STRIKER (v.o.)
No one had ever outlined a physical
fitness program for them and they had no
athletic equipment.

Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow
dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling
through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse
dunk shot.

STRIKER (v.o.)
We also emphasized nutrition and taught
them to watch their diets.

Another native hits a long jump shot.

STRIKER (v.o.)
The exercise improved their physical
fitness and condition.

One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim.

STRIKER (v.o.)
My working with them seemed to reinforce
our objectives of group cooperation and
controlled-competitive activity.

Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline.
As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and
shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion.

STRIKER
I think they're getting the hang of it!
When we re-enlist I'll teach them
baseball!

ELAINE
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time
for us to go back home -- to the plans we
made before the war.

STRIKER
A lot of people made plans before the war.
Like George Zipp.

Elaine walks away, dejectedly. CAMERA STAYS with Striker as
he pours Gator-Ade into a glass.

STRIKER (v.o.)
I guess it was at that moment that I first
realized Elaine had doubts about our
relationship. And that as much as anything
else led to my drinking problem.

Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of
Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

We did come back to the States. I tried a

I'm sorry I had to wake you. I'm just

worry about.

Middle-aged lady, MRS. YAFFE, having overheard this
conversation, beckons to Elaine.

MRS. YAFFE
Stewardess, I think the man next to me is
a doctor.

The MAN next to her is wearing a surgical cap with mask.
Hanging around his neck is a stethoscope. He's sleeping.

ELAINE
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to
wake you. Are you a doctor?

DR. RUMACK
That's right.

ELAINE
We have some passengers who are very sick.
Could you come and take a look at them?

DR. RUMACK
Yes. Yes, of course.

Rumack picks up bag and exits with Elaine.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT

Rumack and Elaine enter. Rumack stoops over to Shirley, and
surgical instrument is slapped into his hand from o.s. He
pokes her stomach with his hand.

DR. RUMACK
Pain there?

She winces and nods.

DR. RUMACK
May I see your tongue, please?

She sticks her tongue out. Rumack pulls on it until it is
obviously too long. He continues to pull, and the tongue
becomes multi-colored magician's scarves. Then he pulls out
a bouquet of flowers followed by a white dove.

DR. RUMACK
I'll be back in a minute.

Rumack takes Elaine aside.

DR. RUMACK
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got
to land as soon as we can. This woman has
to be gotten to a hospital.

ELAINE
A hospital? What is it?

DR. RUMACK
It's a big building with patients. But
that's not important right now. Tell the
Captain I must speak to him.

Can't you take a guess?

OVEUR
Well...not for another two hours.

ELAINE
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And
Randy says there are five more cases, and
they ate fish, too.

DR. RUMACK
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What
did the navigator eat?

ELAINE
He had fish, too.

Oveur is picking up on the conversation.

DR. RUMACK
All right, now we know what we're up
against. Every passenger on this plane who
ate fish for dinner will become violently
ill within the next half hour.

Oveur looks down at his dinner tray and sees skeleton of the
fish he just ate.

ELAINE
Just how serious is it, doctor?

DR. RUMACK
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight
fever.

Oveur experiences what the doctor is describing.

DR. RUMACK
Then a dryness in the throat. As the virus
penetrates the red blood cells the victim
becomes dizzy and begins to experience a
rash and itching. From there the poison
works its way into the central nervous
system causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling. At
this point, the entire digestive system is
rendered useless, causing the complete
collapse of the lower bowels, accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence...until
finally the poor bastard is reduced to a
quivering, wasted piece of jelly.

Oveur passes out and pitches forward onto the controls.

planes?

The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome.

STRIKER
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a
long time ago. I wouldn't know anything
about it.

RANDY
Would you go up, please?

He has a moment of indecision. The Indian encourages Striker
with an adamant nod. Striker gets up to leave. The Indian,
relieved, blows out the match.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT

Jack is sitting across the aisle from a 65-year-old
con貞ervatively dressed SPINSTER. He pulls a flask from his
coat pocket and takes a swig. She eyes him dis苔pprovingly.

JACK
Would ya like a little whiskey, ma'am?

SPINSTER
(insulted)
Certainly not.

She inserts a two inch straw in her nose and snorts a couple
lines of cocaine off a piece of glass.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Striker enters.

STRIKER
(to Rumack and Randy)
The stewardess said...

STRIKER'S POV

Empty pilot's seat and inflated automatic pilot.

STRIKER
Both pilots!

DR. RUMACK
Can you fly this airplane and land it?

STRIKER
Surely you can't be serious.

DR. RUMACK
I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
What flying experience have you had?

STRIKER
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the
Air Force, but this plane has four
engines. It's an entirely different kind
of flying...all together!!!

RANDY/RUMACK
(all together)
It's an entirely different kind of flying.

STRIKER
Besides, I haven't touched any 虺ind of
plane in six years.

DR. RUMACK
Mister Striker. I know nothing about
flying. All I know is this: you're the
only person on this plane who can possibly
fly it. You're the only chance we've got.

DRAMATIC MUSIC as Striker turns to face the controls.

STRIKER'S POV

CAMERA PANS controls. CAMERA KEEPS PANNING and PANNING as WE
SEE more and more controls ad absurdum.

Hinshaw grabs Air Controller #1's tummy.

HINSHAW

AIR CONTROLLER #2

McCROSKEY
We'll need a pre-landing flight check.
Tell 'em I'm in the dispatch office and I
want it here fast.

AIR CONTROLLER #2
It's your wife.

McCROSKEY
(into phone)
I want the kids in bed by nine. I want the
dog fed, the yard watered, and the gate
locked. And get a note to the milkman --
no more cheese!

He slams dowm the phone. He leans his hands on the desk.

McCROSKEY
Where the hell is Kramer?

On the wall behind him there is a picture of McCroskey
leaning his hands on a desk.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Kramer and a mutilated Carey are en route to airport. Kramer
is at the wheel. Through rear window is obvious REAR
PROJECTION of passing road.

KRAMER
(into phone)
No, we can't do that; the risk of a
flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000.
No, feet!

He hangs up phone.

KRAMER
One of the passengers is going to land
that plane.

CAREY
Is that possible?

KRAMER
Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot.
Thousand to one. I know this guy.

CAREY
You do? Who is it?

We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a
bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.

KRAMER
His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him
during the war. And that won't make my job
any easier tonight.

REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION.

KRAMER
Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up
to a point. But he was one of those men
who, well, let's just say he felt too much
inside. Maybe you know the kind.

Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then
weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel.

KRAMER
It takes a certain type to perform under
pressure. Striker didn't have it.

By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback
chasing and shooting at Kramer's car.

KRAMER
Ate his heart out over every name on the
casualty lists. The upshot of it is that
he went all to pieces on one particular
mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen
again tonight.

EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly
this plane!

STRIKER
That's what I've been trying to tell these
people.

DR. RUMACK
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently,
so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on
this plane is in a desperate situation.
Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.

STRIKER
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the
thrust, this must turn on the landing
lights.

He flips a switch. The plane dives.

Randy leaves, Jack shakes Mrs. Hammen by the shoulders.

JACK

Get back to your seat; I'll take care of

Sister Angelina taps Rumack on the shoulder.

SISTER ANGELINA

Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

Sister Angelina starts shaking Mrs. Hammen.

SISTER ANGELINA

AIR CONTROLLER #1
(into phone)
This guy doing the flying has no airline
experience at all. He'll be a menace to
himself and everything else in the air...
(he pauses to listen)
...Yes, birds too.

Kramer enters, picks up clipboard, and reads it.

McCROSKEY
(into phone)
Okay, okay. He's a terrible risk, but what
other choice have we got?

McCroskey hangs up phone.

McCROSKEY
Well, that's the whole story, Rex,
everything we know.

KRAMER
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair
of sunglasses.

KRAMER
As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war. He'll have enough
on his mind without remembering those days
when -- well, when things weren't so good.

McCROSKEY
Well, right now things aren't so good. And
while we're talking there are a hundred
and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a
decision.

KRAMER
Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker
was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long
time ago...

A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer.

KRAMER
...but my feeling is that when the going
gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's
gonna fold up.

McCROSKEY
Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn
and talk this guy down! You're going to
have to let him get the feel of this
airplane on the way; you'll have to talk
him onto the approach; and so help me,
you'll have to talk him right down to the
ground!

A watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the
table.

KRAMER
Very well then. Put Striker on the
speaker.

McCROSKEY
Okay, you can use the radio over there.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
drinking.

He pulls a flask trom the drawer and takes a swig.

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT

Kramer at dispatch radio. He picks up mike.

KRAMER
Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex
Kramer speaking.

McCroskey joins Kramer at dispatch radio.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

DRAMATIC MUSIC as we see Striker's ominous look of
recognition.

STRIKER
(dramatically)
Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and
clear.

INT. DISPATCH - NIGHT

Kramer sits at the mike. An Air Controller is standing next
to him, but only his mid-section is in FRAME.

KRAMER
All right. It's obvious you remember me.

The Air Controller is scratching his behind.

KRAMER
So what do you say you and I just forget
about everything except what we have to do
now?

The Air Controller is now scratching his crotch.

KRAMER
You and I are going to bring this plane in
together.

The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants
straightening out his underwear.

KRAMER
Before we start, I'd like to say
something. I know that right now things
must look pretty rough up there.

The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands
inside his pants.

KRAMER
But if you do what I tell you, when I tell
you to do it, there's no reason you can't
bring that plane in.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

STRIKER
Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know
I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm
going to need all the luck there is.

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT

KRAMER
Stand by, Striker.
(to McCroskey)
The one hope we have is to build this man
up. I've got to give him all the
confidence I can.
(into microphone)
All right, Striker, have you ever flown a
multi-engine plane before?

STRIKER (v.o.)
No. Never.

KRAMER
Shit!

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Striker over hears conversation on radio.

KRAMER (v.o.)
This is a goddamn waste of time. There's
no way he can land this plane! Route 'em
into Lake Michigan and at least avoid
killing innocent people!

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT

McCROSKEY
Grab hold of yourself! You've got to talk
them down. You're the only chance they've
got!

Kramer lights cigarette.

KRAMER
(into mike)
All right, Striker, now you listen to me
and you listen close. Flying is no
different than riding a bicycle...it just
happens to be a lot harder to put baseball
cards in the spokes. Now, if you just
follow my instructions...

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Two vultures are sitting on back of Striker's seat.

KRAMER (v.o.)
...there's no reason why you shouldn't
have complete confidence in your chances
to come out of this thing alive and in one
piece.

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT

KRAMER
First, I want you to familiarize yourself
with the controls. Later we'll run through
the landing procedure.

Kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out
the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and
ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an
EXPLOSION O.S.

KRAMER
All right. Now I'd like you to disengage
the automatic pilot. But watch any violent
movement of the controls, like you used to
make in Spitfires and Phantoms.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

STRIKER
(into microphone)
Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic
pilot.

Striker switches off automatic pilot button. Automatic pilot
shoots upward out of the seat. Elaine is thrown to the
floor. Striker struggles desperately to control the plane.

EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

flying erratically.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

KRAMER (v.o.)
(matter of factly)
Just remember, the controls will feel very
heavy compared to a fighter.

Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is
drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the
rear of the cockpit.

KRAMER (v.o.)
Don't worry about that. It's perfectly
normal. You must watch your airspeed
closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both
your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
have additional play due to increased
drag, but you can compensate by lowering
manifold pressure below 154. Now there's
one other thing. Have you someone up there
who can work the radio and leave you free
for flying?

STRIKER
Yes! The stewardess is here with me!

Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands
clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at
engineer's console.

KRAMER (v.o.)
Have her take the co-pilot's seat.

Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the
plane. He hands Elaine the mike.

STRIKER
The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye
on that number three engine. It's running
a little hot.

MILTON
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth

one person -- a very wonderful person --
makes you always think of yourself as part

lost. I couldn't function socially and I
couldn't function in business.

BERNICE
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't
be expected to.

MILTON
But I think it's time we stopped talking
about me. A woman like you -- why haven't
you ever married?

BERNICE
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's
all too easy to answer.

MILTON
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman
like you became so involved in your work,
you didn't have time for marriage.

BERNICE
I wish I could fool myself into believing
that that's the reason. The truth of the
matter is, nobody ever asked me.

MILTON
You know, here we are having coffee
together, and discussing education and
business and economy...and we don't even
know each other's names...full names I
mean.

BERNICE

Doctor Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been

I'm not married.

DR. RUMACK
Randy, we're going to make it. You've got

Mrs. Hammen enters alcove.

MRS. HAMMEN
Lorison, do you have any idea when we'll

McCroskey and Kramer are at watercooler. McCroskey is
filling cup while Kramer drinks.

McCROSKEY
Rex, I've decided that the best thing to
do is to foam the runway -- let him do a
wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler.

Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey drinks.

KRAMER
(filling up another cup)
No, the risk of fire is too great. If she
starts burning, you write off all those
people who can't get out of there on their
own power.

McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer drinks.

McCROSKEY
(filling up another cup)
Well that's better than writing them all
off? Are you going to play God with a
hundred and 38 lives?

Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

KRAMER
(filling up another cup)
No. A belly landing isn't all that simple.
It takes a good pilot to keep from
smearin' himself all over the runway.

McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket as Kramer drinks.

McCROSKEY
(filling up another cup)
If Striker has the guts to try this, he
deserves the best shot we can give him.
We've gotta foam that runway.

Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

KRAMER
(taking another cup)
His only shot's with the wheels down. I've
seen foam tear a man's guts out.

McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer throws cup
into wastebasket.

McCROSKEY
And if Striker goes to pieces?

KRAMER

That's a risk we'll just have to take.

Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey throws cup

STRIKER
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil

the shit's gonna hit the fan.

INT. DISPATCH - CLOSEUP - FAN - NIGHT

The shit hits it. PULL BACK to include:

KRAMER
I told him to watch that oil temperature.
What the hell's he doing up there?

He picks up the mike.

KRAMER
Striker, that plane can't land itself! It
takes a pilot who can handle pressure.

McCROSKEY
Ease up, Rex! He hasn't flown for years!
It's not his fault. It could happen to any
pilot.

HINSHAW
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck!

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

STRIKER
He's right. I can't take the pressure. I
was crazy to think I could land this

ELAINE
But Ted, you're the only...

STRIKER
I don't care. I just don't have what it
takes. They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.

As Striker leaves he puts autopilot into pilot's seat.
Elaine is on the verge of tears.

DRAMATIC MUSIC.

Air Controller #2 enters.

AIR CONTROLLER #2
Bad news. The fog's getting thicker.

HINSHAW
And Liz Taylor is getting larger!

McCROSKEY
Ya know, this would be a tough landing for
anyone to make. Maybe, if we hold them off
for a bit we'll get a break in the

KRAMER
All right, but let's wait until they reach

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT

Outside stewardess' alcove. Striker fills a cup from
drinking fountain then pours it on his head. He sits down
dejectedly on stewardess' fold-out seat. Rumack approaches.

STRIKER
I know what you're going to say, so save
your breath.

Rumack sits.

DR. RUMACK
No. I haven't a thing to say. You've done
the best you could. You really have. The
best you could. I guess we can't expect to
win 'em all. I want to tell you something
I've kept to myself for years. I was in
the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was
on duty late one night when a badly
wounded pilot was brought in from a raid.
He could barely talk, but he looked at me
and he said, "Doc. The odds were against
us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm
glad we did. The captain made the right
decision." The pilot's name was George
Zipp.

Striker looks up. Notre Dame Fight Song is heard in b.g.

STRIKER
George Zipp said that?

DR. RUMACK
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc,"
he said, "Sometime when the crew is up
against it and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go out there with all
they've got and win just one for the
Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,
Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too
good. That's for sure."

STRIKER
(rejuvinated)
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

Striker boldly starts toward cockpit.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Striker enters. Elaine, unaware of his return, is listening
to Kramer on the radio.

KRAMER (v.o.)
All right, you'd better stay up there for
a bit. As soon as the fog lifts, we'll
bring you in.

STRIKER
I'll take it, Elaine.

She turns to face him. A dramatic moment. Striker enters
pilot seat and takes mike from Elaine's hand.

STRIKER
Listen to me, Kramer. Doctor Rumack says
the sick people are in critical condition
and every minute counts. We've got to land
now!

KRAMER (v.o.)
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what a
landing like this means. You more than
anybody. I'm ordering you to stay up
there!

STRIKER
No dice, Chicago. I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in...I guess the foot's
on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT

McCROSKEY
He'll never bring it down in this soup.
Never! Not one chance in a million.

KRAMER
I know. I know. But it's his ship now, his
command; he's in charge, he's the boss,
the head man, the top dog, the big cheese,
the head honcho...

Air Controller #2 rushes up to McCroskey and Kramer,
carrying a newspaper.

AIR CONTROLLER #2
Chief, look at this!

Kramer grabs newspaper.

KRAMER
(reading)
'Passengers Certain to Die?!?!?!?!?!'

McCROSKEY
'Airline Negligent?!?!?!?!?!'

He hands the paper to Hinshaw.

HINSHAW
(looking at newspaper)
There's a sale at Penny's!

McCroskey grabs paper from Hinshaw.

KRAMER
(to men in Dispatch)
All right, I'll need three men up in the

You, Neubauer. You, Macias.

HINSHAW

He puts his ear to the ground.

HINSHAW

don't know where that finger's been!
Gunderson?

GUNDERSON

was a living hell. Do you know what it's
like to fall in the mud and get kicked? In
the head? By an iron boot? Of course you
don't. No one does. That never happens.
Sorry, Ted. Dumb question. Strike that.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - BOARDING AREA - NIGHT

Randy is assisting Hari Krishnas and Black Dudes from plane.

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

McCroskey, dressed in wet suit and flippers and oxygen tank

sea urchins.

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

Lisa Davis and her mother enter ambulance. It pulls from

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

ROMANTIC MUSIC.

Striker and Elaine are alone on the runway. Behind them is

look up to the cockpit.

EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Automatic pilot is at controls. He salutes Striker and
Elaine and winks at CAMERA.

GRAPHIC: 1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

The lair is 1960's high-tech. We see a huge oversized
conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES,
including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket
and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

ANGLE ON: A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT. THE RINGED
HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY CAT.

DR. EVIL
(face always unseen)
Gentlemen, are we all here? Good. As
you know, my plot to high- jack
nuclear weapons and hold the world
hostage has failed. Again.  This
organization will not tolerate
failure.

He presses a button. The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic
doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip back and fall into
a pit. Their chairs return empty and smoking.

DR. EVIL

for Austin Powers!

EXT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

MUSIC: Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet
pants walking down the street in rhythm, a la Saturday Night
Fever.

We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of
Mystery.

He's a swinger, with medium-length Mod hair and sideburns
and he wears National Health Services glasses.

Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs. It is
that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to
a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO
BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him. They all
start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

FREEZE FRAME - TECHNICOLOR BLUE TINT - TITLE CARD

(PRODUCTION NOTE: ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR
FREEZE FRAMES A LA SWEET CHARITY.)

In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently
to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit. One wears a
metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl. The other wears
a see-through Mary Quant dress.

AUSTIN
(taking photos)
Alright, luv! Love it!  Turn... pout
for me baby. Smashing!

We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH. The model in
the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

AUSTIN
Crazy baby. Give me some shoulder.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
(beat)
No. No.  Show me love. Yes!  And...
done. Here you go, luv. I'm spent.

Austin throws the camera in the air behind him. An ASSISTANT
scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

AUSTIN
Get these off to Fab Magazine right
away.

SUPERMODEL 1
Austin, you've really outdone yourself
this time.

AUSTIN
Thanks, baby.

SUPERMODEL 2
(suggestively)
We could have another photo session
back at my flat.

AUSTIN
(coyly)
Oh, behave!

SUPERMODEL 3
Austin, I love you!

AUSTIN
So many women, so little time.

A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site. They
recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

MOD GIRL 1
It's Austin Powers!

Austin runs away. The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's
Night.

EXT. CARNABY STREET

Two BAD GUYS attack Austin. He JUDO CHOPS them.

AUSTIN
Judo chop! Judo chop!

The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH

Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned. The mob runs
by.

He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

EXT. GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY

Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALACE GUARD standing at attention
just outside his guard box.

Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up,
but to no avail. Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER from
behind the guard's head and presents it to him. They both
crack up.

EXT. PHOTO BOOTH

The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody
inside.

Austin steps out.

ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS. The fourth
panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that
says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

AUSTIN
You might want to protest a bit louder
next time, luv.

The both laugh.

FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT

The passport opens. We see Austin's dour photo. Then he gives
an insane grin, showing his bad teeth. The page flips and we
see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

EXT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup. The blind man,
obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin. Austin
wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to
knee him the balls.

EXT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF
SCHOOLGIRLS.

After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a
baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to
run.

A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a
large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing
off just ahead of the crowd.

EXT./INT. JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON,
a beautiful woman in her thirties.

They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

AUSTIN
Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

MRS. KENSINGTON
Hello, Austin

Just then, a FLASHING RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a
distinctive PHONE RING.

MRS. KENSINGTON
That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief
of British Intelligence.

The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.
ANGLE ON: PICTURE PHONE SCREEN. We see BASIL EXPOSITION a
distinguished older man. A desk plate reads: "Basil
Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence."

BASIL EXPOSITION
(on picture phone)
Hello, Austin. This is Basil
Exposition, Chief of British
Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery, and
you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington.
The year is 1967, and you're talking
on a picture phone.

AUSTIN
We know all that, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
I just wanted to be extremely clear
so that everyone knows what's going
on at any given time. We've just
received word that Dr. Evil, the
ultimate square, is planning to take
over the world.

AUSTIN
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in
jail for good.

BASIL EXPOSITION
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week,
Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel
Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's
planning a trap for you tonight at
the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat
Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus
here in swinging London.

A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing
Austin's position and the location of the club.

AUSTIN
Just where you'd never think to look
for him. We'll be there.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Good luck, Austin.

AUSTIN
Thank you.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...

AUSTIN
Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION
(pause)
Be careful.

AUSTIN
Thank you.
(to Mrs. Kensington)
Let's go, baby!

Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight leather
fightsuit. She looks fabulous.

INT. ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB

It's a swinging club. FREAKS abound. In one corner, there is
a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress.

MICK JAGGER
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick
Jagger.

AUSTIN
Hey, Mick!

MICK JAGGER
Are you more satisfied now sexually,
Austin?

AUSTIN
Well, you can't always get what you
want.

MICK JAGGER
(thinking)
"You can't always get what you want!"
That's a great title for a song!
I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a
big hit.

AUSTIN
Good on ya, man.

MICK JAGGER
Groovy!

In one corner ANDY WARHOL sits in front of his multi-colored
Elvis (or equivalent). He body paints a butterfly on the
thigh of a MOD GIRL wearing a metallic miniskirt outfit.

ANDY WARHOL
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

AUSTIN
Hey, how are you?

ANDY WARHOL
Hungry.

AUSTIN
Here, have this can of Campbell's
Tomato Soup.

Austin hands Andy a can of soup.

ANDY WARHOL
I'm going to paint this can of soup
and become famous and not give you
any credit for it.

AUSTIN
If you can become famous, everyone
will have their fifteen minutes of
fame, man.

ANDY WARHOL
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going
to use that quote and not give you
any credit for that, either.

AUSTIN
Smashing!

INT. ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB

HER MAJESTY, THE QUEEN is giving Austin a Victoria's Cross
like the Lyndon Johnson scene in Forrest Gump. Behind them,
are two COLDSTREAM GUARDS and the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.

QUEEN
Austin Powers, Britain owes you a
debt of gratitude.

Austin gives a cheeky look to Mrs. Kensington.

QUEEN
I understand you were wounded. Where
were you hit?

AUSTIN
In the but-tocks.

QUEEN
That must be a sight. I'd kind of
like to see that.

Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded
bum (matching Gump's) to the queen.

The queen walks away.

QUEEN
(laughing)
Nice buttocks.

In the line-up we also see FOREST GUMP. He has to pee very
badly.

MRS. KENSINGTON
We've got to find Dr. Evil!

AUSTIN
Wait, I've got an idea.

He PUNCHES a PRETTY MOD GIRL in the face, knocking her out
cold.

EVERYONE
Ohhh!

MRS. KENSINGTON
Austin, why in God's name did you
strike that woman?

AUSTIN
That ain't no woman! It's a man,
man. It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.

Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig. She is a MALE ASSASSIN.
The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him. The assassin
hits the ground and pulls out a dagger. Mrs. Kensington kicks
the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a head-lock
from behind.

AUSTIN
Where's Doctor Evil?

ANGLE ON: A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.

The finger pulls the trigger of a spear gun. The assassin
falls forward. A spear protrudes from his back.

Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door. They give
chase.

INT. CLUB - BACK ROOM

They enter. Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.

AUSTIN
I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.

DR. EVIL
(unseen, through mist)
Not this time. Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!
(calling out)
See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.
A sign on the egg reads "CRYOGENIC FREEZING BEGINNING."

MRS. KENSINGTON
My God! He's freezing himself.

Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair. The ceiling opens up
and the egg rises through the opening. Everything begins to
RUMBLE. Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.

EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

The Bob's Big Boy rocket begins to LIFT OFF.

EXT. CLUB - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

PEOPLE outside the club react to the rocket.

EXT. EARTH FROM SPACE

The Bob's Big Boy rocket leaves the atmosphere. Mr.

love is dead, and greed and avarice
once again rule the world.

INT. M.O.D. - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE CRYOGENIC STORAGE FACILITY)

Basil Exposition (now aged 30 years), Command Gilmour, and
NICOLAI BORSCHEVSKY, a Russian General, put on extreme-weather
gear over their uniforms.

BASIL EXPOSITION
As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had
himself frozen in 1967. Soon after,
Austin Powers volunteered to have
himself frozen, in the event Dr.
Evil should ever return. We believe
Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot
to take over the world. And that,
gentlemen, is why we're here.

COMMAND GILMOUR
Outstanding re-cap, Exposition.

Command Gilmour opens a vault door. COLD MIST escapes.

INT. M.O.D. - CRYOGENIC STORAGE FACILITY

They pass a row of cryogenic holding berths, each containing
a naked PERSON in suspended animation, a la Demolition Man.
They pass GARY COLEMAN, EVEL KINEVEL (with cape), and VANILLA
ICE, all in suspended animation. They pass a now-empty berth
with a plate that reads "JOHN TRAVOLTA."

BORSCHEVSKY
Who is this Austin Powers? Is he a
British operative?

BASIL EXPOSITION
No, he worked freelance, an
internationally renowned swinging
photographer by day and the ultimate
gentlemen spy by night.

Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked. His
hands cover up his private parts. The look on his face
suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'. His glasses
are frosted over. He is very hairy.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

Attention, Stage One, laser cutting

Lasers begin to cut Austin out of the ice in one huge cube.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

He's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened-

BOWL.

He PEES for a while, then a little longer.

And then EVEN LONGER STILL.

The stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than
ever.

He is still PEEING.

Finally, it STOPS.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER (PA)

He begins PEEING again.

A little LONGER.

Then in short staccato BURSTS.

The it STOPS. Pause.

Two DRIPS.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER
Evacuation...

Complete! The cryogenic state of
Austin Powers is now completed.

Austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle a la Dr.
Frankenstein's lab. NURSE TECHNICIANS administer injections
and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors.

AUSTIN
(weakly)
Where am I?

BASIL EXPOSITION
You're in the Ministry of Defense.
It's 1997. You've been cryogenically
frozen for thirty years.

AUSTIN
(shouting)
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

BASIL EXPOSITION
The shouting is a temporary side-
effect of the unfreezing process.

AUSTIN
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...
(shouting)
THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!

BASIL EXPOSITION
You might also experience a slight
fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at
moments of extreme relaxation. Austin,
this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic
Command, and General Borschevsky,
Russian Intelligence.

AUSTIN
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?

BASIL EXPOSITION
A lot's happened since you were
frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.

AUSTIN
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs
will finally pay for their crimes
against the people, hey Comrades?

BASIL EXPOSITION
We won, Austin.

AUSTIN
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!
(to Gilmour)
Nice tie. Yea capitalism!

COMMANDER GILMOUR
Mr. Powers, the President's very
concerned. We've got a madman on the
loose in Nevada.

BASIL EXPOSITION
It's Dr. Evil.

AUSTIN
When do I begin?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Immediately. You'll be working with
Ms. Kensington.

AUSTIN
You mean Mrs. Kensington?

BASIL EXPOSITION
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long-
since retired. Ms.  Kensington is
her daughter.

VANESSA KENSINGTON, Mrs. Kensington's daughter, beautiful,
mid- twenties, English, enters. She is wearing a very
conservative, business pantsuit. Her hair is up and she wears
glasses. Austin's breath is taken away.

She sets down a huge stack of files.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Vanessa's one of our top agents.

AUSTIN
(out loud, to himself)
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing
body. I bet she shags like a minx.
How do I tell them that because of
the unfreezing process, I have no
inner monologue?
(pause)
I hope I didn't say that out loud
just now.

There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.

VANESSA
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate
you to the Nineties. You know, a
lot's changed since 1967.

AUSTIN
Well, as long as people are still
having promiscuous sex with many
anonymous partners without protection,
while at the same time experimenting
with mind-expanding drugs in a
consequence-free environment, I'll
be sound as a pound.

VANESSA
My mother's told me all about you.

AUSTIN
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's
the truth, goddamn me.
(pause)
God, I hope that's witty. How's your
mum?

VANESSA
My mother's doing quite well, thank
you very much.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will
get you set up. She's very dedicated.
Perhaps, a little too dedicated.
(aside to Austin)
She's got a bit of a bug up her ass.
Good luck, Austin, the world's

AUSTIN
Thank you, Exposition.

Oh, and Austin...

Be careful.

Actually, my name's Austin Powers.

AUSTIN
Danger's my middle name.

OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue
crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace
cravat. One gold medallion with peace
symbol. One pair of Italian shoes.
One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple.
One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones,
Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made
penis enlarger pump.

AUSTIN

That's not mine.

CLERK

One credit card receipt for Swedish-
made penis enlarger pump, signed
Austin Powers.

AUSTIN
I'm telling you, baby, that's not
mine.

CLERK
(reading)
One warranty card for Swedish-made
penis enlarger pump, filled out by
Austin Powers.

AUSTIN
I don't even know what this is. This
sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

CLERK
(reading)
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger
Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is
My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.

The clerk shows the book to Austin, who is humiliated.

AUSTIN
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll
sign. Just to get things moving,
baby.

VANESSA
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward
to working with you, but do me a
favor and stop calling me baby. You

We have to leave immediately. We've

INT. PRIVATE PSYCHEDELIC JET

The inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet... rust shag carpet,

chairs. Vanessa works on her lap top.

AUSTIN
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How
does a hot chick like you end up
working at the Ministry of Defense?

VANESSA
I went to Oxford and excelled in
several subjects, but I ended up
specializing in foreign languages. I
wanted to travel -- see the world.
In my last year I was accepted into
the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies
sector. I thought I was off on an
exciting career, but my job was to
read everything printed in every
country. It's very boring. My whole
day is spent reading wedding
announcements in Farsi. If I do well
with this case, I finally get promoted
to field operative...

AUSTIN
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen,
why don't we go into the back and
shag?

VANESSA
I beg your pardon?

AUSTIN
I've been frozen for thirty years,
man, I want to see if my bits and
pieces are still working.

VANESSA
Excuse me?

AUSTIN
My wedding tackle.

VANESSA
I'm sorry?

AUSTIN
My meat and two veg.

VANESSA
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you
must be a little confused, but we
have a very serious situation at
hand. I would appreciate it if you'd
concentrate on our mission and give
your libido a rest.

AUSTIN
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

VANESSA
A Chigro?

AUSTIN
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese,
part Negro...  Chigro.

VANESSA
(offended)
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.
It's considered offensive.

AUSTIN
That's right. You're supposed to say
'colored' now, right?
(spotting the flight
attendants)
Here's the stewardesses! Bring on
the sexy stews!

The STEWARDESSES enter. They're not dressed very sexily. One
of them is a man and another wears braces.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?
We're called 'flight attendants'
now, thank you very much.

AUSTIN
Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a
whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
My name is Mrs. Wilkenson. There are
a few things we need to discuss.
First of all, we're not wearing these.

She holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Also, I have some questions about
the itinerary. It says here, '4:30 -
Dinner, 5:30 - Everyone Gets Naked
and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 -
Orgy'?

AUSTIN
Seems pretty straightforward, don't
you think...listen darling, I think
you're a fabulous bird. Can I get
your telephone number?

FLGHT ATTENDANT
(mock sexy)
Sure, it's easy to remember.
(writing on his hand)
It's 777-FILM. We have to prepare
the craft for take-off now.

AUSTIN
Smashing! When we land I'll give you
a tinkle on the telling bone.

The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.

AUSTIN
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's
two things I know about life: one,
Americans will never take to soccer.
Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses
love to shag!  They're shag-mad,
man! Let me ask you a question,
Vanessa, and be honest.

VANESSA
Sure.

AUSTIN
Do I make you horny?

VANESSA
What?

AUSTIN
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know.
To you, am I eros manifest?

VANESSA
I hope this is part of the unfreezing
process.

AUSTIN
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger...
That's what I do, I swing.

VANESSA
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but
let me be perfectly clear with you,
perhaps to the point of being
insulting. I will never have sex
with you, ever.  If you were the
last man on Earth and I was the last
woman on Earth, and the future of
the human race depended on our having
sex simply for procreation, I still
would not have sex with you.

Austin is oblivious.

AUSTIN
What's you point, Vanessa?

EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

Austin's plane. Time has passed.

IINT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Vanessa's lap-top BEEPS.

COMPUTER VOICE
You've got mail!

ANGLE ON: the computer screen. It's Basil Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is
Basil Exposition, from British
Intelligence.  There's a company in
Las Vegas called Virtucon that we
think may be linked to Dr. Evil.
Many of the Virtucon executives gamble
at the hotel/casino where you'll be
staying. That's the first place you
should look.  Well, I'm off to the
chat rooms.

AUSTIN
Thank you, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...

AUSTIN
Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful.

Vanessa closes her lap-top.

PILOT
(over loudspeaker)
Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning
our final descent into Las Vegas
International Airport. Flight
attendants will be coming by to
collect your drinks, and I'll ask
you at this time to please return to
the main cabin and put your bean-
bags in the upright position.

Austin and Vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags.

EXT. AIRPLANE LANDING - NIGHT

We see a plane's lights landing at night.

GRAPHIC: The Trip Using a sequence of snap-zooms, colored
projections, and flashing lights, we see Austin dance crazily
a la BOB FOSSE with a GO-GO GIRL in a bikini with the Austin
Powers logo body-painted on her midriff.

The sequence lasts five seconds and is very groovy.

EXT. LAS VEGAS MONTAGE - NIGHT

Sights and sounds of Las Vegas icons at night: "Welcome to

Caesar's Palace. The montage ends on the modern skyline of
Las Vegas.

INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

DR. EVIL
(face again unseen)
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a
long time, but I'm back. It's all
gone perfectly to plan except for
one small flaw. Because of a technical
error, my right arm was not frozen.
I was therefore by definition only
partially frozen.

ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA. HE IS TERRIFIED AND SWEATY,
EYES DARTING LEFT AND RIGHT.

MUSTAFA
But my design was perfect!  Your
autonomic functions were shut down,
and even though your arm wasn't
frozen, the aging was retarded,
therefore your right arm is only
slightly older than the left.

DR. EVIL
Can't you see I'm only half a man?
Look at me, I'm a freak!

He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.

MUSTAFA
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--
(holding up tennis
ball)
--work with this tennis ball. Squeeze
it for twenty minutes a day. A few
months of that and it'll be just as
strong as the other arm...

DR. EVIL
And look what you've done to Mr.
Bigglesworth!

ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair
around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

MUSTAFA
We could not anticipate feline
complications due to the reanimation
process&emdash;

DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Silence!

ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

Dr. Evil presses a button. Mustafa's chair tips back and he
falls backwards into a pit.

MUSTAFA
(blood-curdling scream)
Ahhhhhhhhh!

DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Let this be a reminder to you all
that this organization will not
tolerate failure.

Mustafa's SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

ANGLE ON: DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE IS IN HIS EARLY
FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS SCAR ON HIS CHEEK.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

More muffled SCREAMS.

DR. EVIL
We've got a lot of work to do.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Someone help me! I'm still alive,
only I'm very badly burned.

DR. EVIL
(slightly distracted)
Some of you I know, some of you I'm
meeting for the first time.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone
call an ambulance? I'm in quite a
lot of pain.

DR. EVIL
(very frustrated)
You've all been gathered here to
form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.

He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
If somebody can open the retrieval
hatch down here, I could get out.
See, I designed this device myself
and...oh, hi! Good, I'm glad you
found me.  Listen, I'm very badly
burned, so if you could just--

SFX: Muffled Gunshot

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Ow! You shot me!

DR. EVIL
Right. Okay. Moving on.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
You shot me right in the arm!  Why
did--

SFX: Muffled Gunshot. Dr. Evil waits. Nothing.

DR. EVIL
Let me go around the table and
introduce everyone. Frau Farbissina...

ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA

DR. EVIL
...founder of the militant wing of
the Salvation Army. Random Task...

RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform.

DR. EVIL
...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman
extraordinaire. Show them what you
do.

He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.
It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.

DR. EVIL
Thank you, Random Task. Patty
O'Brien...

PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes.

DR. EVIL
...ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?

Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet.

DR. EVIL
A superstitious man, he leaves a
tiny keepsake on every victim he
kills. Scotland Yard would love to
get their hands on that piece of
evidence.

PATTY O'BRIEN
(heavy Irish accent)
Yes, they're always after me lucky
charms!

Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.

PATTY O'BRIEN
What? What?  Why does everyone always
laugh when I say that? They are after
me lucky charms.

They cannot contain their LAUGHTER.

PATTY O'BRIEN
(angry)
What?

FRAU FARBISSINA
(through suppressed
laughter)
It's a television commercial with
this little cartoon Leprechaun who
is a benevolent imp who is very
concerned that these children will
steal his lucky charms which are
foodstuffs fashioned into various
shapes-- hearts, moons, clovers,
what have you...
(pause)
It's a long story.

DR. EVIL
Finally, I come to my number two
man. His name: Number Two.

NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch.

DR. EVIL
For thirty years, Number Two has run
Virtucon, the legitimate face of my
evil empire.

He hits a button. The conference table slowly rotates to
reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted
by various miniature models.

NUMBER TWO
Over the last thirty years, Virtucon
has grown by leaps and bounds. About
fifteen years ago, we changed from
volatile chemicals to the
communication industry. We own cable
companies in thirty-eight states.

The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.

NUMBER TWO
In addition to our cable holdings,
we own a steel mill in Cleveland.

A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland.

NUMBER TWO
Shipping in Texas.

A ship off the coast of Texas illuminates.

NUMBER TWO
Oil refineries in Seattle.

An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle.

NUMBER TWO
And a factory in Chicago that makes
miniature models of factories.

The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago.

NUMBER TWO
We also own the Franklin mint, which
makes decorative hand-painted theme
plates for collectors.
(holds up plate)
Some plates, like the Gone With The
Wind series, have gone up in value
as much as two-hundred and forty
percent, but, as with any investment,
there is some risk involved.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called
blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain
are the wealthiest landowners in the
world. Either the Royal Family pays
us an exorbitant amount of money, or
we make it look like Prince Charles,
the heir to the throne, has had an
affair outside of marriage and,
therefore, they would have to divorce.

There is an uncomfortable silence.

NUMBER TWO
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did
have an affair. He admitted it, and
they are now divorced, actually.

DR. EVIL
People have to tell me these things.
I've been frozen for thirty years,
throw me a bone here.
(pausing)
OK, no problem. Here's my second
plan. Back in the Sixties I had a
weather changing machine that was in
essence a sophisticated heat beam
which we called a "laser."  Using
this laser, we punch a hole in the
protective layer around the Earth,
which we scientists call the "Ozone
Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet
rays would pour in, increasing the
risk of skin cancer. That is, unless
the world pays us a hefty ransom.

There is another uncomfortable silence.

NUMBER TWO
Umm, that also has already happened.

DR. EVIL
Right.
(pause)
Oh, hell, let's just do what we always
do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons
and hold the world hostage.
(pause)
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention
that a breakaway Russian Republic
called Kreplachistan will be
transferring a nuclear warhead to
the United Nations in a few days.
Here's the plan. We get the warhead,
and we hold the world ransom...
(dramatic pause)
...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

There is an uncomfortable pause.

NUMBER TWO
Don't you think we should ask for
more than a million dollars? A million
dollars isn't that much money these
days.

DR. EVIL
All right then...
(dramatic pause)
...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

There is another uncomfortable pause.

NUMBER TWO
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion
dollars a year.

DR. EVIL
(pleasantly surprised)
Oh, really?
(slightly irritated)
One-hundred billion dollars.
(pause)
OK, make it happen. Anything else?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Remember when we froze your semen,
you said that if it looked like you
weren't coming back to try and make
you a son so that a part of you would
live forever?

DR. EVIL
Yes.

FRAU FARBISSINA
Well, after a few years, we got sort
of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you
to meet your son.

DR. EVIL
My son?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Yes.
(calling out)
Scott!

SCOTT EVIL walks out. He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a
Kurt Cobain T-shirt.

SCOTT EVIL
Hi.

DR. EVIL
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr.
Evil.
(emotional)
I have a son! I have a son! Everyone,
I have a son!
(gesturing to globe)
Someday, Scott, this will all be
yours.

SCOTT EVIL
I haven't seen you my whole life and
now you show up and want a
relationship? I hate you!

EXT. JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY

Vanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag.

AUSTIN
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!

VANESSA
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a
secure cellular phone, an on-board
computer, and a Global Geosynchronous
Positioning Device. Oh, and finally,
this.

The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various
dental hygiene products-- floss, toothpaste, toothbrush,
dental mirror, and cleaning tool.

AUSTIN
Let me guess. The floss is garotte
wire, the toothpaste contains plastic
explosives, and the toothbrush is
the detonation device.

VANESSA
No, actually. I don't know how to
put this really. Well, there have
been fabulous advances in the field
of dentistry.

AUSTIN
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?

EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door.

INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin
takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite
suitcases.

AUSITN
Which side of the bed do you want?

VANESSA
You're going to sleep on the sofa.
I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers,
that the only reason we're sharing a
room is to support our cover story
that we're a married couple on
vacation.

AUSTIN
So, shall we shag now, or shall we
shag later? How do you like to do
it? Do you like to wash up first?
Top and tails? A whore's bath?
Personally, before I'm on the job, I
like to give my undercarriage a bit
of a how's-your-father.

AUSTIN
(off her angry reaction)
I'm just joking, Vanessa. Trying to
get a rise out of you.

They both laugh.

VANESSA
Let's unpack.

HER LUGGAGE: In the inside flap is a types list of contents.
All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags.

AUSTIN
Gor blimey, nerd alert.

HIS LUGGAGE: He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington
shaver with huge English plug.

HER LUGGAGE: She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel
iron and a Braun blow drier.

HIS LUGGAGE: He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle
of Jurgens lotion.

HER LUGGAGE: She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a
plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie
marked "Shoes."

HIS LUGGAGE: He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and
Hai Karate cologne.

HER LUGGAGE: She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - Top
Secret."

HIS LUGGAGE: He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump.

Vanessa sees it.

AUSTIN
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's
playing a prank on me!  Honestly,
this isn't mine.

VANESSA
(suffering)
I'm sure.

AUSTIN
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-
ling.

Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm.
After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the
handset.

MOVIE PHONE VOICE
(through handset)
Hello! And welcome to 777-FILM!

Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa.

AUSTIN
I got her answering machine.

INT. CASINO

Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino. Austin gives
PEOPLE two-handed handshakes. They stare like he's a freak.

AUSTIN
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot
my x-ray glasses.

VANESSA
Here, use mine.

AUSTIN
I'm going to use a cover name. It's
important that it be a generic name
so that we don't draw attention to
ourselves.

INT. CASINO

Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table. Number Two
is there, complete with eyepatch. On one side of him is a
beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress
with a white kerchief on her head. On the other side of him
is an extremely large-breasted BIMBO.

AUSTIN
Do you mind if I join you?

NUMBER TWO
Not at all.

The DEALER deals.

DEALER
Seventeen.

Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.

NUMBER TWO'S MONOCULAR POV

GRAPHIC: "X-RAY EYEPATCH". We see everyone at the casino in
their underwear. He looks at the next card in the shoe. It
is a 4.

NUMBER TWO
Hit me.

DEALER
You have seventeen, sir. The book
says not to, sir.

NUMBER TWO
I like to live dangerously.

The dealer draws a card from the card shoe.

DEALER
Four. Twenty-one.

Everyone at the table applauds. The dealer deals to Austin
and Number Two.

DEALER
(to Austin)
Eighteen.
(to Number Two)
Sixteen.

NUMBER TWO'S POV

GRAPHIC: "X-RAY EYEPATCH". He looks at the shoe at the shoe
and sees that the next card is a ten.

NUMBER TWO
I'll stay.

DEALER
(to Austin)
Sir?

Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses.

AUSTIN'S POV

GRAPHIC: "X-RAY SPECS". Everyone is in their underwear, but
it is completely blurry.

DEALER
(to Austin)
Sir?

VANESSA
(quietly)
What's wrong?

AUSTIN
(quietly, to Vanessa)
I can't see a bloody thing.

VANESSA
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're
prescription X-ray glasses. I have
very bad astigmatism.

DEALER
Sir, the table is waiting.

AUSTIN
(panicking)
Uh, hit me.

The table MURMURS.

DEALER
On an eighteen, sir?

AUSTIN
Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

The dealer deals him the ten.

NUMBER TWO
You're very brave.

AUSTIN
Cards are not my bag, man. Allow
myself to introduce... myself. My
name is Ritchie Cunningham.

Vanessa is mortified.

AUSTIN
(indicating Vanessa)
This is my wife, Enid.

NUMBER TWO
My name is Number Two.

He extends his hand to shake. Austin extends his hand, but
misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast. There is an
awkward pause. Austin takes off his glasses.

VANESSA
(rescuing him)
Number Two? That's an unusual name.

NUMBER TWO
My parents were hippies.
(indicating Italian
woman)
This is my Italian confidential
secretary.

ITALIAN WOMAN
(Italian accent)
My name is Alotta
(quickly)
Alotta Fagina.

AUSTIN
I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.
It sounds like you're saying your
name is a lot of... never mind.
Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.
It's been a gas.

NUMBER TWO
Bye-bye, Mr... Cunningham?

AUSTIN
Peace, baby.

Austin and Vanessa leave.

INT. CASINO

VANESSA
Why did you leave so soon?

AUSTIN
That cat Number Two has an X-ray
eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him,
man. Listen, we should go back to
the room, but first I have to go to
the naughty chair and see a man about
a dog.

He heads to the rest room.

INT. HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO

Number Two has been watching them. He presses a BUTTON.

INT. BATHROOM - CASINO

Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy
hat.  Austin enters a stall. The Texan enters the adjoining
stall.

TEXAN
Good luck, buddy. You don't buy food,
you rent it.

AUSTIN
Too right, youth.

INT. BATHROOM STALL

Austin sits down. Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing
Patty O'Brien. His charm bracelet JINGLES. Austin looks back.
Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.

He wraps it around Austin's throat. Austin gets his thumbs
between the wire and certain death.

AUSTIN
(grunting)
Uh, uh!

INT. TEXAN'S STALL

The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about
frantically. He can hear the GRUNTING.

TEXAN
Hey pardner, just relax, don't force
it! Use some creative visualization.

INT. AUSTIN'S STALL

Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's
crotch. Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.

PATTY O'BRIEN
(groaning)
Ughhhhh...

Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty
O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it
hovers above the toilet bowl.

AUSTIN
Who does Number Two work for?

INT. TEXAN'S STALL

TEXAN
That's right! Show that turd who's
boss!

INT. AUSITN'S STALL

AUSTIN
Who does Number Two work for?

PATTY O'BRIEN
(quietly, straining)
Go to hell.

Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and FLUSHES. We
hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien.

INT. TEXAN'S STALL

The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.

INT. AUSTIN'S STALL

Austin reaches into Patty O'Brien's wallet. We see his Dr.
Evil ID card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her
address.

INT. BATHROOM

Austin is leaving his stall. The Texan can see Patty O'Brien's
dead body head-first in the toilet.

TEXAN
Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

ANGLE ON THE FLOOR OF AUSTIN'S STALL

Patty O'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor. The charms
come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover. A
second later, a blue diamond falls out.

INT. PSYCHEDELIC SCENE BREAK

GRAPHIC: Love Power Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily.

EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - MORNING

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos
and files on Dr. Evil, Virtucon, etc.

In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin
is asleep on the couch.

VANESSA
(into phone)
Hello Mum?

INT. MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE - LONDON

An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front
room.

MRS. KENSINGTON
(on phone)
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

VANESSA (V.O.)
Great.

MRS. KENSINGTON
How's Austin?

VANESSA (V.O.)
He's asleep.

MRS. KENSINGTON
You didn't...

INT. HOTEL SUITE

VANESSA
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the
couch.

In the background, we see Austin get off the couch. He is
very naked and very hairy. A strategically placed vase of
flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I'm proud of you.

VANESSA
Why?

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
Because you managed to resist Austin
Power's charms.

Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.
Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number
Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.

VANESSA
Well, God knows he tried, but I've
been rather firm with him, Mummy.
You didn't tell me he was so obsessed
with sex. It's bizarre.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
You can't judge him by modern
standards. He's very much a product
of his times. In my day he could
have any woman he wanted.

VANESSA
What about his teeth?

SPLIT SCREEN - HOTEL ROOM/MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE

MRS. KENSINGTON
You have to understand, in Britain
in the Sixties you could be a sex
symbol and still have bad teeth. It
didn't matter.

VANESSA
I just don't see it.

MRS. KENSINGTON
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in
his charms, it's impossible to get
out.

VANESSA
Did you ever...

MRS. KENSINGTON
Of course not. I was married to your
father.

VANESSA
Did you ever want to?

MRS. KENSINGTON
Austin is very charming, very
debonair. He's handsome, witty, has
a knowledge of fine wines,
sophisticated, a world-renowned
photographer. Women want him, men
want to be him. He's a lover of love--
every bit an International Man of
Mystery.

We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the
screen.

Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED. Vanessa
holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and
in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.

VANESSA
You didn't answer my question, Mum.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I know. Let me just say this: Austin
was the most loyal and caring friend
I ever had.

I will always love him.

AUSTIN (V.O.)
Good morning, luv, who are you on
the phone with?

VANESSA
(to her mother)
Do you want to talk to him?

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
No, it's been too long. Best to leave
things alone.

VANESSA
(to Austin)
I'm on with a friend!
(to her mother)
Look, I'd better go. I love you.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I love you, Vanessa.

Vanessa hangs up. Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers"
robe.

AUSTIN
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you
have on clean underwear.

VANESSA
Why?

AUSTIN
We've got a doctor's appointment--
an evil doctor's appointment.

We see a black limousine pull up in front. Random Task and
another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - BUSHES

We see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa. She and Austin
are on a stakeout. Austin's Jag is in the background.

VANESSA
A limousine has just pulled up.

AUSTIN
Let me see.

Austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens
attached to his vintage camera.

EXT. VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE

The limousine speeds off.

EXT. BUSHES

VANESSA
Let's go get him!

AUSTIN
He's too well-protected right now.

VANESSA
We can't just sit here, Austin.

AUSTIN
Let me tell you a story. There's
these two bulls on top of a hill
checking out some foxy cows in the
meadow below. The young bull says,
'hey, why don't we run down the hill
and shag us a cow?', and the wise
old bull replies, 'no, why don't we
walk down the hill and shag all the
cows?'

VANESSA
I don't get it.

AUSTIN
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.

VANESSA
Unfortunately, while you told that
stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

AUSTIN
No worries, luv. We'll just give
Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty.

AUSTIN
My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly
beautiful. Stay right where you are.

Austin changes lenses and begins SNAPPING PICTURES.

VANESSA
I hate having my picture taken.

AUSTIN
You're crazy. The camera loves you,
Vanessa.

Vanessa does a few coy poses.

AUSTIN
Go, Vanessa, go!

Vanessa lets go a little bit more.

WHITE CYC

Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional
photo shoot, and she's loving it.

Austin begins SNAPPING pictures, all the while changing her
look, touching her hair.

AUSTIN
Alright, luv! Love it!  Turn... pout
for me Vanessa. Smashing!  Crazy.
Give me some shoulder.
(pause)
Yes! Yes! Yes!

He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse. She nods
no.

Austin nods yes. She sheepishly undoes them. A MONTAGE of
her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than the
other.

AUSTIN
Show me love. Yes!
(beat)
Smashing!

Vanessa is flanked by two buff MALE MODELS a la Madonna.

AUSTIN
Great! Great! Smashing!
(beat)
Yes! Yes! Yes!
(beat)
No! No!

Love it. Give me love. Give me mouth. Give me lips.

(BEAT)
Going in very close now.

He goes in closer.

AUSTIN
Give me eyes.
(closer)
Give me cornea.

Give me aqueous humour.
(closer)
Coming in closer. Give me retina,
Vanessa.
(closer)
Even closer. Give me optic nerve.

And... done.

He throws the camera down.

AUSTIN
I'm spent. What say you we go out on
the town?

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT

Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double-
decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner. They're
drinking champagne.

Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding
his cutlery very English. He has cut one piece to the point
to which it's a speck.  He puts it on the fork and offers it
to her.

AUSTIN
Fancy a nibble?

VANESSA
I couldn't have another bite.

They laugh. They drink. It's TOM JONES, serenading them.

They begin to dance.

Austin gives her roses. Austin is wooing her.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT

They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying
each other's company. Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock. She
graciously accepts.

LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE

Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of
backgrounds-- neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

Sounds of MOANS and GROANS. We see Austin's backside sticking
out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled
leg straining upwards.

VANESSA (O.S.)
Watch out, you're on my hair!

AUSTIN (O.S.)
Sorry. Move your hand to the left.
There you go. Gorgeous.

VANESSA (O.S.)
Go! Just go!

We hear a SPINNING SOUND.

AUSTIN (O.S.)
Left hand, blue.

We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER. She
reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing.

AUSTIN
Wait a tick, I forgot something in
the lobby.
(moving behind the
couch)
I know what. I'll take the stairs.

Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.

AUSTIN
Maybe I'll take the escalator.

Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator.

AUSTIN
Why take the escalator when I could
take a canoe?

Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch.

VANESSA
I haven't had fun like that since
college.

AUSTIN
I'm sorry.

VANESSA
Why?

AUSTIN
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had
to die.

She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound.

VANESSA
Always wanting to have fun, that's
you in a nutshell.

AUSTIN
No, this is me in a nutshell.

Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell.

AUSTIN
Help! I'm in a nutshell! What kind
of nut has such a big nutshell? How
did I get into this bloody great big
nutshell?

Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

AUSTIN
You're smashed, Vanessa.

VANESSA
I am not.

AUSTIN
Oh, yes you are.

VANESSA
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm
always the designated driver.

They are both on the bed. She looks at him. He looks at her.
There is an awkward silence.

She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away.

AUSTIN
I can't. You're drunk.

VANESSA
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just
beginning to see what my Mum was
talking about.
(pause)
What was my mother like back in the
Sixties? I'm dying to know.

AUSTIN
(sentimental)
She was very groovy. She was so in
love with your Dad. If there was one
other cat in this world that could
have loved your Mum and treated her
as well as you Dad did, it was me.
But, unfortunately for yours truly,
that train has sailed.

Austin hears SNORING. He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep.
A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a RED LIGHT FLASHES.

Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE
PHONE. It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane.

BASIL EXPOSITION
(on the picture phone)
Hello, Austin, this is Basil
Exposition from British Intelligence.
Thank you for confirming the link
between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find
out what part Virtucon plays in
something called Project Vulcan.
I'll need you and Vanessa to get on
that immediately.

AUSTIN
Right away, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Where is Vanessa, by the way?

Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure.

AUSTIN
She's working on another lead right
now.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Then you'll have to go it alone.
Good luck.

AUSTIN
Thank you, Basil.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...

AUSTIN
(knowing)
Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Let me remind you that because of
the unfreezing process you might
experience flatulence at moments of
extreme relaxation.

AUSTIN
Oh, yes. Thank you.

BASIL EXPOSITION
There's one more thing, Austin.

AUSTIN
Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful.

AUSTIN
Thank you.

Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card.

INT. ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE

Austin is in a dark penthouse suite. Austin passes a piece
of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy.

AUSTIN
Paging Dr. Freud.

He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase. He
opens it.

FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT

Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature
camera/pendant.

AUSTIN
(photographing)
Give it to me baby. Super.

We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's
holdings in a flow-chart fashion.

AUSTIN
Pout for me, luv. Smashing. Yes!
Yes! Yes! No! No!

One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects." Under
that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie",
and in CLOSE-UP-- "Project Vulcan."

We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a
cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."

AUSTIN
And I'm spent.

The front door opens. It's Alotta.

AUSTIN
You seem surprised to see me.

ALOTTA
I thought you'd quit while you were
ahead.

AUSTIN
What, and watch all my earnings go...
(smug)
Down the toilet?

ALOTTA
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham,
was it?

AUSTIN
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I
call you Alotta...
(pause)
Please?

ALOTTA
You may.

AUSTIN
Your boss, Number Two, I understand
that cat's involved in big underground
drills.

ALOTTA
Virtucon's main interest is in cable
television, but they do have a
subterranean construction division,
yes. How did you know?

AUSTIN
(smug)
I didn't, baby, you just told me.

ALOTTA
It's for the mining industry, Mr.
Cunningham. We can talk about business
later. But first, let me slip into
something more comfortable.

AUSTIN
Behave!

MUSIC: "The Look of Love" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66
Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen. In silhouette she takes
off her clothes and puts on a robe. She opens a pair of
sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.

INT. JAPANESE BATH

She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on
her shoulder, and enters the water.

ALOTTA
Come in.

AUSTIN
I'd rather talk about Number Two.

ALOTTA
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?
Come in, and I'll show you everything
you need to know.

Austin takes off his clothes. He is extremely hairy. He goes
in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over.

ALOTTA
May I wash you?

AUSTIN
Groovy.

She washes his back. Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet
and looks through it.

ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION. It reads "AUSTIN POWERS,
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."

ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS: CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC.

She puts his wallet back in his trousers.

ALOTTA
In Japan, men come first and women
come second.

AUSTIN
Or sometimes not at all.

ALOTTA
Care for some saki?

AUSTIN
Sak-i it to me!

Alotta pours them saki. Alotta unscrews the diamond in her
ring.

A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation Pills."
She drops two PILLS into his drink.

Austin takes a sip. His eyes glaze over. He's instantly woozy.

ALOTTA
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

AUSTIN
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin.

AUSTIN
(reciting poem)
'Pardon me for being rude, It was
not me, it was my food.  It just
popped up to say hello, and now it's
gone back down below.'

ALOTTA
That's very clever. Do you know any
other poems?

AUSTIN
(reciting in a lofty
tone)
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the
corner fudge is made.  Stick your
finger in the hole, And out comes a
tootsie roll!'

ALOTTA
(genuinely moved)
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your
health.

AUSTIN
To my health.

ALOTTA
Kiss me.

They go to kiss. She notices HIS TERRIBLE TEETH, CLOSE-UP.

ALOTTA
Do you mind if I ask you a personal
question?

AUSTIN
Is it about my teeth?

ALOTTA
Yes.

AUSTIN
Damn. What exactly do you do at
Virtucon?

ALOTTA
I'll tell you all in due time, after
we make love. But first, tell me
another poem.

AUSTIN
I think it was Wordsworth who penned
this little gem: 'Press the button,
pull the chain, out comes a chocolate
choo-choo train.'

ALOTTA
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make
love, you silly, hairy little man.

She glides over to him.

The Party Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily.

INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

Dr. Evil, Number Two, and Frau Farbissina sit at the large
conference table.

DR. EVIL
Austin Powers is getting too close.
He must be neutralized. Any
suggestions?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr
Doctor. I have created the ultimate
weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring
on the Fembots!

MUSIC: Sexy Matt Helm-type theme THREE FEMBOTS enter. They
are beautiful buxom multiracial girl/robots in Sixties clothes
and white go-go boots.

DR. EVIL
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated
strumpets are the perfect bait for
the degenerate Powers.

FRAU FARBISSINA
These are the latest word in android
replicant technology.  Lethal,
efficient, brutal. And no man can
resist their charms. Send in the
soldiers!

SEVEN SOLDIERS come in. They are immediately attracted to
the FEMBOTS. They throw down their guns and come to the girls
zombie-like.

When they get within range, guns POP out of the Fembots'
bras and begin FIRING, killing the guards.

DR. EVIL
Quite impressive.

FRAU FARBISSINA
Thank you, Herr Doctor.

DR. EVIL
I like to see girls of that caliber.
By caliber, I mean both the barrel
size of their guns and the high
quality of their character... Forget
it.

SFX: 60'S ELECTRONIC BUZZER

NUMBER TWO
That would be the video feed from
Kreplachistan.

Dr. Evil and Number Two watch a large screen. We see stock
footage of a Russian warhead. We cut into a close-up of
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS being taken prisoner by VIRTUCON SOLDIERS
in the front of a military vehicle.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, Phase One is complete.
The warhead is ours. Let Phase Two
begin! Patch us through to the United
Nations security secret meeting room.

INT. UN SECRET MEETING ROOM

REPRESENTATIVES of various countries in their traditional
garb around a large UN-style meeting table. The BRITISH are
dressed in bowler hats. The AMERICANS all look like JFK. The
CANADIANS are dressed as Mounties. The ARABS are dressed in
ceremonial robes, etc.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

They all look up at the SCREEN.

DR. EVIL
In a little while, you'll find out
that the Kreplachistani warhead has
gone missing. Well, it's in safe
hands. If you want it back, you'll
have to pay me... ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

The UN representatives are confused. Number Two COUGHS.

DR. EVIL
(frustrated)
Sorry. ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!

The representatives ARGUE amongst themselves.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY
Gentlemen, silence!
(to Dr. Evil)
Now, Mr. Evil--

DR. EVIL
(angry)
Doctor Evil! I didn't spend six years
in evil medical school to be called
'mister'.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
Excuse me. Dr. Evil, it is the policy
of the United Nations not to negotiate
with terrorists.

DR. EVIL
Fine, have it your way. Gentlemen,
you have five days to come up with
one hundred billion dollars. If you
fail to do so, we'll set off the
warhead and destroy the world.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
You can't destroy the world with a
single warhead.

DR. EVIL
Really? So long.

The screen goes BLANK.

DR. EVIL
(to evil associates)
Gentlemen, in exactly five days from
now, we will be one-hundred billion
dollars richer.
(laughing)
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
(slightly louder)
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

EVIL ASSOCIATES
(laughing with him)
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES
(louder and more
staccato)
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
(louder again, and
even more evil and
maniacal)
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
(pause)
Ohhhh, ahhhhhh...
(pause, quieter)
Ohhh, hmmmm.
(pause, very quiet)
hmn.

There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should
have FADED TO BLACK. The evil associates look around the
room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

DR. EVIL
Okay... Well... I think I'm going to
watch some TV.

EVIL ASSOCIATES
Okay. Sure.

They exit the frame awkwardly.

INT. BRITISH MAKESHIFT HQ

Austin and Vanessa enter past two BRITISH MILITARY POLICEMAN.
There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks,
etc.

We see Basil, dressed as the Vegas-era Elvis.

AUSTIN
Hello, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up
to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked
a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan
and is holding the world ransom for
one-hundred billion dollars. If the
world doesn't pay up in four days,
he's threatening to destroy the world.

AUSTIN
Thank you, Exposition. Only two
things, scare me, and one is nuclear
war.

BASIL EXPOSITION
What's the other?

AUSTIN
Excuse me?

BASIL EXPOSITION
What's the other thing you're scared
of?

AUSTIN
Carnies.

BASIL EXPOSITION
What?

AUSTIN
Circus folk.
(shudders)
Nomads, you know. They smell like
cabbage.

BASIL EXPOSITION
(suffering him)
Indeed... If we could get back to
the business at hand. It's one thing
to have a warhead, it's quite another
thing to have the missiles to launch
it.

AUSTIN
Maybe these photographs are the last
piece of that puzzle.
(hands him the photos)
I've uncovered the details on Project
Vulcan. It's a new subterranean
warhead delivery system.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Good God, and underground missile.
We've long feared such a development.

VANESSA
When did you find that out, Austin?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Austin did some reconnaissance work
at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last
night.

VANESSA
Oh.

BASIL EXPOSITON
Our next move is to infiltrate
Virtucon. Any ideas?

VANESSA
Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their
facilities every hour. I suggest we
pose as tourists and do site-level
reconnaissance.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, Austin,
I want you to meet somebody.

Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Austin, this is my mother, Mrs.
Exposition. She's in from Tunbridge
Wells in Kent. Can you believe, she's
ninety-two years old?

Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

BASIL EXPOSITION
My God, Austin, what have you done?

AUSTIN
That's not your mother, that's a
man!

Austin begins tugging on her hair.

MRS. EXPOSITION
Owww...my hair!

BASIL EXPOSITION
Get away from my mother!

VANESSA
Austin, have you gone mad?

The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

MRS. EXPOSITION
(through pain)
Who is that man? Why did he hit me?

BASIL EXPOSIION
Don't worry, mother. Lie down. Austin,
you have a lot of explaining to do.

AUSTIN
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was
a man.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Damn it, man! You're talking about
my mother!

AUSTIN
You must admit, she is rather mannish.
No offense, but if that's a woman,
it looks like she's been beaten with
an ugly stick.

VANESSA
Really, Austin!

AUSTIN
Look at her hands, baby! Those are
carpenter's hands.

BASIL EXPOSITION
All right, Austin, I think you should
go.

AUSTIN
I think if everyone were honest,
they'd confess that the lady looks
exactly like a man in drag.

BASIL EXPOSITION
I'm leaving!
(pause)
Oh, and Austin?

AUSTIN
Yes, Basil?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful.

AUSTIN
Thanks.

Basil escorts his mother out.

VANESSA
Austin, may I have a word with you?

AUSTIN
Of course, luv.

VANESSA
Listen, I know I'm just being
neurotic, but I can't shake this
suspicious feeling about that Italian
secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I
don't want to sound paranoid, but
I've had some bad relationships in
the past, and I have some jealousy
issues. You went to her penthouse.
It makes me feel so small to give
into these insecurities, but I can't
help but feel this weird, irrational,
unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm
sorry.

AUSTIN
Don't be sorry. You're right to be
suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged
her rotten.

VANESSA
(stunned)
I can't believe you made love to her
just like that. Did you use
protection?

AUSTIN
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter
automatic.

VANESSA
No, did you use a condom?

AUSTIN
Only sailors use condoms, man.

VANESSA
Not in the Nineties.

AUSTIN
Well they should, filthy beggars,
they go from port to port.  Alotta
meant nothing to me.

VANESSA
(pause)
Well, it means something to me. If
you want us to have a relationship,
you've got to be a one-woman man.

AUSTIN
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're
everything to me.

VANESSA
You just don't get it, do you, Austin?
Good night. Welcome to the Nineties,
you're going to be very lonely.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC: "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin
looks at his address book. ANGLE ON THE PAGE: We see a list
of names crossed out, with comments written in beside them.
Beside Jimi Hendrix we see "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin,
"Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich";
Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.
He picks up his new pair-- REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER PUMPS.
He pumps them too much and they explode.

Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below. We see
the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S and
BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened
Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on. It
explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle. The
NOISE is awful.

Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III. His fighter gets his head
ripped off, and blood spews out.

Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

INT. BATHROOM

Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too
loose and water shoots all around the bathroom.

EXT. CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of
Las Vegas.

INT. CASINO BAR - NIGHT

Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY
YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort. They look at him like he's a
freak.

Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down
with that". They shoot him sarcastic peace signs. Austin is
pleased.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years
video on TV. Vanessa enters.

AUSTIN
Hello, luv.

VANESSA
Thirty years of political and social
upheaval. The fall of the Berlin
wall, a female Prime Minister of
England, the abolishment of Apartheid,
a fascinating tapestry of human strum
und drang.

AUSTIN
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was
gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't
see that one coming.

VANESSA
Basil was very concerned to know
where you were last night.

AUSTIN
Out and about, doing odds and sods.

VANESSA
I'll tell him. By the way, I've
decided we should keep our
relationship strictly professional.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing
six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS. It is
emotionally charged. A lot of pained expressions and coffee
in Styrofoam cups.

SON 1
(crying)
I love you, Dad.

DAD 1
I love you, Son.

They hug. Everyone APPLAUDS. We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

THERAPIST
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank
you. OK, group, we have two new
member. Say hello to Scott and his
father, Mr.... Ehville?

DR. EVIL
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

GROUP
Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.

SCOTT EVIL
(into it)
Hello, everybody.

THERAPIST
So, Scott, why don't we start with
you. Why are you here?

SCOTT EVIL
Well, it's kind of weird.

THERAPIST
We don't judge here.

SCOTT EVIL
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad
for the first time three days ago.
He was partially frozen for thirty
years. I never knew him growing up.
He comes back and now he wants me to
take over the family business.

THERAPIST
And how do you feel about that?

SCOTT EVIL
I don't wanna take over the family
business.

DR. EVIL
But Scott, who's going to take over
the world when I die?

SCOTT EVIL
Not me.

THERAPIST
What do you want to do, Scott?

SCOTT EVIL
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe
I'd be a vet or something, cause I
like animals and stuff.

DR. EVIL
An evil vet?

SCOTT EVIL
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting
zoo or something.

DR. EVIL
An evil petting zoo?

SCOTT EVIL
(shouting)
You always do that!
(calm)
Anyways, this is really hard, because,
you know, my Dad is really evil.

THERAPIST
We don't label people here, Scott.

SCOTT EVIL
No, he's really evil.

THERAPIST
Scott.

DR. EVIL
No, the boy's right. I really am
evil.

THERAPIST
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're
here, that's what's important. A
journey of a thousand miles begins
with one step.

SCOTT EVIL
I just think, like, he hates me. I
really think he wants to kill me.

THERAPIST
OK, Scott, no one really wants to
"kill" anyone here. They say it, but
they don't mean it.

The group LAUGHS.

DR. EVIL
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I
am trying to kill him. My Evil
Associates have cautioned against
it, so here he is, unfortunately,
alive.

THERAPIST
We've heard from Scott, now let's
hear from you.

DR. EVIL
The details of my life are quite
inconsequential.

THERAPIST
That's not true, Doctor. Please,
tell us about your childhood.

GROUP
Yes, of course. Go ahead, etc.

DR. EVIL
Very well, where should I begin? My
father was a relentlessly self-
improving boulangerie owner from
Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery. My mother
was a fifteen-year-old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed
feet. My father would womanize, he
would drink, he would make outrageous
claims, like he invented the question
mark.  Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of
general malaise that only the genius
possess and the insane lament. My
childhood was typical.  Summers in
Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring
we'd make meat helmets. If I was
insolent, I was placed in a burlap
bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty
standard, really. At the age of twelve
I received my first scribe. At the
age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named
Vilma ritualistically shaved my
testicles. There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum. At the age of
eighteen, I went off to evil medical
school. From there...

ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP. They are stunned.

ride on an electric tram.

Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a
rancid taste in my mouth. Do you
have a piece of gum?

VANESSA
(in her own world)
Do you think she's prettier than I?

AUSTIN
Who?

VANESSA
You know who.

AUSTIN
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me,
Vanessa. You're being very trippy.

VANESSA
I'm looking at you, and the whole
time I can't help thinking you had
your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

AUSTTIN
Well put. Listen love, we can't keep
having this fight. I'm an
International Man of Mystery.
Sometimes in the course of my work
to save the world I have to shag
some crumpet. It's all part of the
job.

TOUR GUIDE
Welcome to Virtucon, the company of
the future.
(pointing to large
display window)
Virtucon is a leading manufacturer
of many items you'll find right in
your own home. We make steel, volatile
chemicals, petroleum-based products,
and we also own the Franklin mint,
which makes decorative hand-painted
theme plates for collectors.
(holds up plate)
Some plates, like the Gone With The
Wind series, have gone up in value
as much as two-hundred and forty
percent, but, as with any investment,
there is some risk involved.

The people on the tour APPLAUD.

TOUR GUIDE
Coming up on the left, we have the
Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide
range of Virtucon licensed products.
On the right, you'll notice a door
that leads to a restricted area.
Only authorized personnel are allowed
beyond that point.

INT. VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

All the tourists head for the gift shop. Austin notices a
SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with
a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear
Virtucon coveralls.

AUSTIN
I'll take him, you take her.

The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room;
the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room. Austin
and Vanessa follow.

We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING
KNOCKED OUT.

Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls
over their clothes. Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.
They go through the doors into the restricted area.

INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

They approach the security GUARD.

VANESSA
Austin, we don't look anything like
our photo badges.

AUSTIN
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a
mind control technique during my
travels to India. I learned it from
my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a
chaste man who mysteriously died of
a disease that had all the hallmarks
of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch
me, now.

They reach the guard.

GUARD
Hi, folks. You're entering a
restricted zone. Can I see your
security badges?

AUSTIN
Sure.

They flash their security badges to the guard.

ANGLE ON AUSTIN. WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES,
RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE OTHER, BACK AND FORTH.

MUSIC: Mystical Indian sitar.

AUSTIN
(hypnotist-like)
Everything seems to be in order.

GUARD
(looking at the badges)
Hey, wait a minute--

ANGLE ON AUSTIN. He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.

GUARD
(trance-like, in
Austin's English
accent)
Everything seems to be in order.

VANESSA
That's amazing. Let's go!

AUSTIN
Hold on one second.

Austin again does his mind control trick.

AUSTIN
Here, have a piece of gum.

GUARD
(in trace)
Here, have a piece of gum.

He hands Austin a piece of gum.

AUSTIN
Don't mind if I do.

GUARD
(slipping out of trance)
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last
piece of gum.

Austin does his mind-control again.

AUSTIN
No, no, I want you to have it, even
if it's my last piece.

GUARD
(trance-like)
No, no, I want you to have it, even
if it's my last piece.

AUSTIN
(mind-controlling)
I'm going to go across the street
and get you some sherbert.

VANESSA
(irritated)
Austin, we have to go!

She pulls him away.

GUARD (O.S.)
(faintly)
I'm going to go across the street
and get you some sherbert.

Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN -
TOP SECRET." They walk through.

INT. PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits
surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.

SCIENTIST
This is the strongest, sharpest drill
bit ever produced by man.  It weighs
fifteen metric tones and can bore
through a mile-thick bedrock of solid
granite in seven seconds.

INT. VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM

A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count. They
notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram. The
guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.

INT. PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

SFX: ALARM GOES OFF

ANNOUNCER
(on PA)
Attention, there are intruders in
the complex.

All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin
and Vanessa.

SCIENTIST
Get them!

The scientist approach. Austin knocks two of them out cold
with judo chops.

AUSTIN
Judo chop! Judo chop!

Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.
SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway. Austin
and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads
"VIRTUCON STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

INT. STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a
large observation booth. Six STEAMROLLER go around a test
track very slowly.

Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving
steamrollers. Security guards enter the facility and begin
fanning out in a search.

AUSTIN
Our only way out of here is to drive
out!

They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER,
push him off, and assume the controls.

P.A. (O.S.)
There they are!

Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.
Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.
Austin punches the other one off.

AUSTIN
Hang on! I'm going to floor it!

He engages a lever. It goes only slightly faster.

TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller. They
are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a
fast-approaching car.

GUARD
Noooooooooooooo!

AUSTIN
Where did you learn to shoot?

VANESSA
Where did you learn to drive?

ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.

One of the guys jumps out of the way as if "in the nick of
time."

The steamroller is now 8 yards away. The other army guy is
still frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

GUARD
Noooooooooooooo!

VANESSA
Austin, watch out!

AUSTIN
(looking around)
Where? Where?

ANGLE ON THE GUARD.

He's bathed in the headlights of the steamroller, which is
still 3 yards away.

GUARD
Noooooooooooooo!

ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.

Austin is frantically jerking the steering wheel and trying
to downshift. SFX: Metal grinds. The shifter breaks off along
with a gaggle of wares. He desperately jams on the breaks.

ANGLE ON THE GUARD.

He is finally run over by the steamroller.  There is an
inordinate amount of blood and guts.

By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door. They run
out into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY

The coast is clear.

VANESSA
Thank God, Austin, we made it.

AUSTIN
Yes, act naturally and we'll split
this scene the way we came in,
Vanessa.

From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out. It is
Random Task flanked by four SECURITY GUARDS.

INT. STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

We see the aftermath. Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood and
guts with large squeegees and brooms. One of them turns to
reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on his
jumpsuit.

Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and
dust pail to sweep up blood. ZOOM IN on the steamrolled Army
guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES

It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house. We
hear a PHONE RINGING.

INT. KITCHEN

A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

MIDDLE AGED LADY
Hello?
(pause)
Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
(pause)
Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
(pause)
Yes, that's right, he's a henchman
in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
(pause)
What? Killed?
(pause)
How?
(pause)
Run over by a steamroller? Oh my
God. Thank you for calling.

She HANGS UP. A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
Hi Mom! When's Steve coming home? He
said he was going to teach me to
play ball.

MRS. HARWIN
Sit down, Billy, I have some bad
news. As you know, your brother Steven
was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private
Army.

BILLY
Was? What is it, Mom?

MRS. HARWIN
Your brother was run over by a
steamroller.

BILLY
A steamroller?
(bursting into tears)
No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's
been like a father to me.

MRS. HARWIN
I'm sorry son. People never think
how things affect the family of the
henchman.
(hugging him)
I love you, Billy.
(to herself, out loud)
I wonder if we'll be able to receive
Steve's henchman's comp.

Austin and Vanessa are unconscious.

EXT. HIGHWAY

The electric minivan turns onto a dirt road that leads to a
boulder.

EXT. DESERT - BOULDER

The boulder lifts up and the minivan drives into it.

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL

The minivan enters a long cylindrical tunnel.

INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR

The minivan is being lowered on a high-speed elevator.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

VIRTUCON ARMY MEMBERS keep watch. SCIENTISTS check clipboards.

DR. EVIL
Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.
All the evil associates are present. Dr. Evil squeezes a
tennis ball repeatedly. Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch
of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

DR. EVIL
Welcome to my underground lair, Mr.
Powers. Mrs. Kensington's daughter,
how lovely. I believe your name is
Vanessa? I'd shake your hands, except
for obvious reasons.

VANESSA
I don't understand.

DR. EVIL
My hand, dammit! Look at it!

AUSTIN
What's wrong with your hand?

DR. EVIL
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a
little late for that. I'm a freak!
Look at it, it's been rendered
useless.

He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually
normal, just slightly aged.

AUSTIN
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking
your head space.

DR. EVIL
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on
the international stage, Mr.  Powers,
I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the
curtain fall on the third and final
act.

A large telescreen comes on, showing the United Nations Secret
Meeting Room.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.

He presses a button on his chair panel. A giant canvas falls,
unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean
bore-- the VULCAN. It is rather phallic.

AUSTIN
(under his breath to
Vanessa)
Does that make you horny?

VANESSA
(under her breath)
Not now, Austin.

DR. EVIL
The world's most powerful subterranean
drill.

INT. UNITED NATIONS SECRET MEETING ROOM

ON SCREEN: Stock footage of volcanoes erupting and animated
charts of magma squirting through the Earth's layers.

DR. EVIL
(voice over)
So powerful it can penetrate the
Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton
nuclear warhead into the planet's
hot liquid core. Upon detonation,
every volcano on the planet will
erupt.

The various representatives are ABUZZ. Behind the British
delegation sits Basil Exposition. To his right, sits Mrs.
Exposition with a hideous BLACK EYE.

AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE
Why should we pay him the money?
He's only got one warhead and he's
going to detonate it deep underground.

BASIL EXPOSITION
(the light shifts
towards dramatic as
he speaks)
My God, man, don't you understand?
It won't just be active volcanoes,
inactive ones will erupt as well.
Seven-eighths of the Earth's land
mass will be deluged with hot magma.
Tectonic plates will shift, causing
massive earthquakes. Imagine no United
Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no
tea, no freshly toasted crumpets
smothered with Devonshire clotted
cream, the diving mystery of
Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever
the continuity of Britannic majesty,
the demise of this sceptered isle,
this jewel, this England...

BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE
Any word from Powers?

BASIL EXPOSITION
(back to normal)
I'm afraid we've lost contact with
him.

BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE
I see.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
Dr. Evil, it seems we have no choice
but to pay your ransom.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, your deadline is in three
hours. You have your instructions.
Good-bye.

The screen goes BLACK.

DR. EVIL
Come join us for dinner, won't you
Mr. Powers?

INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

Austin and Vanessa are seated at a table with Frau. WAITERS
serve food.

MUSIC: Sexy Matt Helm-type theme

DR. EVIL
I think you'll enjoy the food. I
have the best chef in the world.
His name is Ezekial. He's made of
seventy-five percent plastic.

Scott enters.

DR. EVIL
Scott my boy, come here. How was
your day?

SCOTT EVIL
Well, me and a buddy went to the
video arcade in town and, like, they
don't speak English right, and so my
buddy gets into a fight, and he goes
'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't
speak French or whatever', and the
other guy goes something in Paris
talk, and I go 'um, just back off'
and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make
me'.

DR. EVIL
(trying to hide
contempt)
Fascinating. What are your plans for
this evening?

SCOTT EVIL
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good
tittie movie on Skinemax.

DR. EVIL
And that's how you want to live your
life, is it?

SCOTT EVIL
Yeah. What?

ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS that has everyone's names on it.

Dr.  Evil's hand hovers over the button labeled "SCOTT."
Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.

DR. EVIL
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's
nemesis, Austin Powers.

SCOTT EVIL
Why are you feeding him? Why don't
you just kill him?

DR. EVIL
In due time.

SCOTT EVIL
But what if he escapes? Why don't
you just shoot him? What are you
waiting for?

DR. EVIL
I have a better idea. I'm going to
put him in an easily-escapable
situation involving an overly-
elaborate and exotic death.

SCOTT EVIL
Why don't you just shoot him now?
Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just
shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.

DR. EVIL
One more peep out of you and you're
grounded. Let's begin.

A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa. Dr. Evil
hits a button. One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

DR. EVIL
Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of
mine are joining us for dinner.
They're quite delighted you'll be
part of the meal.

The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts
them in the dipping mechanism.

AUSTIN
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them
to pay?

DR. EVIL
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to
die. Even after they pay me the money,
I'm still going to melt all the cities
of the world with hot magma.
(to guard)
All right, guard, begin the
unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping
Mechanism.

The guard do so. Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly
towards the surface of the water.

DR. EVIL
Release the sharks!
(to the room)
All the sharks have had laser beams
attached to their heads. I figure
every creature deserves a warm meal.

FRAU FARBISSINA
(clearing her throat
nervously)
Dr. Evil?

DR. EVIL
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting
my moment of triumph.

FRAU FARBISSINA
It's about the sharks. Since you
were frozen, they've been placed on
the Endangered Species List. We tried
to get some, but it will take months
to clear up the red tape.

DR. EVIL
(disappointed)
Right.
(to Austin)
Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you
in a tank of piranhas with laser
beams attached to their heads.

Frau clears her throat again.

DR. EVIL
What is it now?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Well, we experimented with lasers,
but you would be surprised at how
heavy they are. They actually
outweighed the piranha themselves,
and the fish, well, they sank to the
bottom and died.

DR. EVIL
I have one simple request-- sharks
with friggin' laser beams attached
to their heads, and it can't be done?
Remind me again why I pay you people?
What do we have?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Sea bass.

DR. EVIL
Right.

FRAU FARBISSINA
They're mutated sea bass.

DR. EVIL
Really? Are they ill-tempered?

FRAU FARBISSINA
Please allow me to demonstrate.

Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope
towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch
through the air. The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls
the rope back. The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

DR. EVIL
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered
sea bass it is.
(to the room)
Come, let's return to dinner. Close
the tank.

SCOTT EVIL
Aren't you going to watch them?
They'll get away!

DR. EVIL
No, we'll leave them alone and not
actually witness them dying, and
we'll just assume it all went to
plan.

SCOTT EVIL
I have a gun in my room. Give me
five seconds, I'll come back and
blow their brains out.

DR. EVIL
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do
you?

Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the
tank.

INT. TANK AREA

Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water. They
can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

VANESSA
What's your plan?

Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing
Austin.

AUSTIN
First, I plan to soil myself. Then,
I plan to regroup and think about
the next move. Any thoughts?

VANESSA
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep
this on me just in case.

She pulls out a container of dental floss.

AUSTIN
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth.
You have to understand, in Britain
in the Sixties you could be a sex
symbol and still have bad teeth. It
didn't matter.

VANESSA
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to
get to the ledge.

AUSTIN
Smashing idea! Give it to me.

Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental
floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo. He
throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches like
a grappling hook.

Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.

Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the
sea bass. Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the
floss. He keeps pulling out floss.

More floss still. The mechanism continues to sink. Finally,
the floss line goes TAUT. Austin ties it off high on the
pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.

Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon-- Vanessa places a
tube of toothpaste in his hand. Meanwhile the guard is
reaching to undo the floss. Austin places the open tube on
his palm, aimed at the guard. Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard
loudly. He turns around.

AUSTIN
Judo chop!

Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of
toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

GUARD
(screaming, rubbing
his eyes)
My eyes! My eyes!

Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing
both ends.

AUSTIN
Hold on, Vanessa!

She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety
right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.
Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared
all over his face.

He and Austin STRUGGLE.

The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's
head dangling over the water. SEA BASS circle. The water
boils, dangerously close to Austin's head.

VANESSA
(shouting)
Austin, watch out!

Austin FLIPS the guard over. The SEA BASS chew the guard's
head off like a blender.

AUSTIN
Not a good time to lose one's head.

VANESSA
Indeed.

AUSTIN
That's not the way to get ahead in
life.

VANESSA
Yes.

AUSTIN
It's a shame he wasn't more
headstrong.

VANESSA
Shut up.

AUSTIN
Fair enough.

They head out a door. ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO. The name
tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

EXT. HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY

It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad
BUSTY WAITRESSES.

INT. HOOTERS RESTAURANT

At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS,
scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

GUY 1
I can't believe John Smith is getting
married tomorrow.

GUY 2
Where is Smittie anyways? It's not
like him to be late for anything,
especially his own stag party.

GUY 3
Well, you know he's a henchman for
Dr. Evil. Sometimes they work late.
Can I just say something that may
sound a little sappy? I think it's a
testament to our friend John that so
many of his buddies showed up in his
honor. There's a lot of love in this
room.

A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

WAITRESS
Hi, I have a phone call here for the
John Smith party.

GUY 1
Hello?
(pause)
Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
(pause)
That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's
private army.
(pause)
What? He's dead?
(pause)
Decapitated by mutated flying sea
bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you.

He hangs up.

GUY 2
(to Guy 1)
Hey Bill, what's wrong? Was that
John? Is he coming late?

GUY 1
Guys, John's not coming.

GUY 2
Why?

GUY 1
He was decapitated by mutated flying
sea bass.

bad about shagging that Italian girl.
I had a sip of sake and all of the
sudden, I don't know what happened.
The whole time I was shagging her--
I mean really shagging her, I mean
it was crazy, I was like a huge

He runs towards to door to exit. Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEMALE
LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up. His
feet leave the floor.

Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin. Nozzles pop out of
the tips of the Fembot's bra.

AUSTIN
Is it cold in here?

A cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles. Austin
is overcome. The room starts to spin.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER - CONTROL AREA

Dr. Evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on.

FEMBOT
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.
Eventually you'll give in.

AUSTIN
Au contraire, I think you can't resist
me.

MUSIC: Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive
dance. He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches
out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his
mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

He throws seven cigarettes one by one. Each cigarette lands
perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth. Austin smokes the
remaining cigarette.

Austin begins to do a seductive striptease. The Fembots are
aroused. He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest,
and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and
forth like in Jacob's Ladder.

Eventually her head explodes. Austin is now stripped down to
his Union Jack bikini briefs and turns to another Fembot.
Her head explodes.

He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly. Then
he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare
foot. He gives a look of disguised pain.

He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot. Her head explodes.
He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot,
whose head explodes.

Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.
Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining
Fembots.

AUSITN
Oh, I fell over.

Their heads explode simultaneously. All the Fembots are lying
on the floor, smoking. Just then, Vanessa enters, flanked by
a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS. She surveys the scene and looks at
Austin in his briefs. She's hurt. The commandos salute Austin.

AUSTIN
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.
(to the commandos)
At ease, boys.

VANESSA

Likewise.

AUSTIN
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas
came out of her...well, and then

The giant probe engine begins to throb and whirl. The tip of
the spinning probe suddenly strikes the floor of the chamber
and burrows into the earth with atomic force. Smoke and debris
explode upwards. The entire chamber quakes violently-- eight

AUSTIN
Don't worry!

They have landed safely, but are surrounded by FIVE PRIVATE
ARMY SOLDIERS, armed to the teeth-- one has a bazooka, one
has a flamethrower, one has a Gatling gun, etc. They see
Austin and throw down their weapons, pulling out KNIVES.

One of the private soldiers runs at Austin and he stabs him.
Another soldier runs at Austin, and Austin also stabs him. A
third private army soldier runs at Austin. Austin does the
stabbing motion.

Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE
FORCE FIELD. He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned
computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the
Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to
prevent you from progressing beyond
this point. You might as well
surrender. Resistance is futile.
Your odds of survival are 23,763,273
to...

AUSTIN
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have
quite a head on your shoulders, I
dare to coin.

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
Yes, I am programmed to answer any
question.

AUSTIN
Really? Let me ask you this. What is
love?

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
That does not compute.

AUSTIN
Why not? It's a question.

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
Love is... love is... love is...

The computers begin to smoke. Alarm bells ring.

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
Remjack! Remjack!
(singing)
Daisy, Daisy...
(faster)
Remjackremjackremjack!

There is a muffled explosion. The computer goes dark. Austin
passes through the force field and heads for the door until
he hears--

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
(on PA)
Subterranean detonation-- one minute
and COUN-ting.

He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

AUSTIN
(to Eastern European
Man)
Where's the abort button?

The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say
'give me one second.'

EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN
(on PA)
Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting.
(to Austin)
It's right over there.

Austin sees the abort button. It is across the room. Just
then, Random Task enters. Austin sees him and goes to shoot
him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off
his SHOE.

Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR

The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD. Austin pauses. The shoe
has not killed him. It has just hurt him slightly.

AUSTIN
Ow! That really hurt. I'm going to
have a lump there, you idiot!  Who
throws a shoe? You fight like a woman.

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
(on PA)
Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

Random task blocks Austin's way to the button. He stands
there, menacing, missing one shoe.

Exposed wires are everywhere. On the counter beside Austin
is a Big Gulp.

AUSTIN
Care for a drink?

Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet. It lands in
front of him on a pile of exposed wires. Electricity travels
through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING
him.

He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.

AUSTIN
Shocking.

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
Three... two... one...

A 50 kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the
control area.

EXT. STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - VOLCANOS ERUPTING

Different volcanoes around the world. Lava spews and flows.

INT. CONTROL AREA

Austin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button. He
flies through the air for an inordinate length of time.

AUSTIN
(slow motion distortion)
Nooooooo!

His hand lands on the button.

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
(on PA)
Abort.

EXT. STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - REVERSE VOLCANO ERUPTIONS

Lava, smoke and debris sucks back into volcanoes around the
world. (Eruption footage run in reverse.)

INT. CONTROL ROOM

Having saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHINE GUN from a
fallen Private Army guy and runs to the door at the back,
chasing Dr. Evil.

INT. CORRIDOR

Austin chases after Dr. Evil.

INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

Austin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase.

AUSTIN
I've got you, Dr. Evil!

DR. EVIL
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so
different, you and I. It's true,
you're British, and I'm Belgian. You
have a full head of hair, mine is
slightly receding. You're thin, I'm
about forty pounds overweight. OK,
we are different, I'm not making a
very good point. However, isn't it
ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very
things you stand for-- swinging,
free love, parties, distrust of
authority- are all now, in the
Nineties, considered to be... evil?
Maybe we have more in common than
you care to admit.

AUSTIN
No, man, what we swingers were
rebelling against were uptight squares
like you, whose bag was money and
world domination. We were innocent,
man. If we'd known the consequences
of our sexual liberation, we would
have done things differently, but
the spirit would have remained the
same.  It's freedom, man.

DR. EVIL
Your freedom has cause more pain and
suffering in the world than any plan
I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom
failed.

AUSTIN
That's why right now is a very groovy
time, man. We still have freedom,
but we also have responsibility.

DR. EVIL
Really, there's nothing more pathetic
than an aging hipster.

Alotta enters. She holds a gun to Vanessa's head.

ALOTTA
Not so fast.

DR. EVIL
Well, it seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.

Just then, Scott Evil enters.

SCOTT EVIL
Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

AUSTIN
It seems the tables have turned again,
Dr. Evil.

DR. EVIL
Not really. Kill the little bastard.
See what I care.

AUSTIN
Man, you are one chilly square!

SCOTT EVIL
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in
group!

DR. EVIL
I had the group liquidated, you little
shit. They were insolent.

SCOTT EVIL
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was
never artificially created in a lab.

DR. EVIL
Scott, don't say that...

Scott runs off. In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun out
of Alotta's hands. Alotta pulls out a knife. Austin SHOOTS
the knife out of her hand. Vanessa grabs Alotta by the throat.

VANESSA
This is for sleeping with my man,
you whore!

ALOTTA
I didn't sleep with him.

VANESSA
I don't believe you.

ALOTTA
(choking)
It's the teeth.

VANESSA
OK, I believe you. But you still
must be chopped.

Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

VANESSA
Judo chop!

Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which
closes and begins to lift up through a hole in the ceiling.
He runs in. On the way, he flips a switch which says "SELF-
DESTRUCT - 5:00 MINUTES."

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)
(on PA)
Five minutes to self-destruct and
COUN-ting.

Austin SHOOTS and misses. Rocket exhaust pours out of the
hole in the ceiling.

AUSTIN
Let's split!

Austin and Vanessa run out the door into the...

INT. CORRIDOR

They pass Number Two, who is front of an open safe, stuffing
his pockets with cash while the others are trying to escape.
Austin and Vanessa run to the main chamber...

INT. MAIN CHAMBER

...to the main corridor...

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR

...past the Fembot lair, over the wedged-in cart, to the
escape ladder. They begin to climb.

INT. MAIN CHAMBER

Explosions, debris, the cavern begins to collapse.

STOCK FOOTAGE - DESERT FLOOR - MERCURY TEST SIGHT

Ground caving in from an underground nuclear explosion.

EXT. RAFT - MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN - DAY

Austin and Vanessa are floating in a large inflatable raft.

FIERY DEBRIS falls in the water around them.

VANESSA
I have something to tell you.

AUSTIN
Lay it on me.

VANESSA
I love you, Austin.

AUSTIN
That's fab, because I love you, too,
Vanessa.

VANESSA
Kiss me.

AUSTIN
Behave!

Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a
passionate kiss. Just as their lips are about to touch,
however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise
of a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD. Their hair is blown all about and
the waves are whipped into a frenzy.

AUSTIN
Just when things were getting
interesting.

ANGLE ON BASIL EXPOSITION

Wearing scuba gear, being lowered on a rope from the
helicopter. He stops just above them.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr.
Evil from destroying the world with
his subterranean nuclear probe, and
somehow you and Agent Kensington
managed to escape unscathed from his
evil lair.

AUSTIN
I'd say that about sums it up,
Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have
something for you.

Basil hands Vanessa an official-looking set of leather-bound
credentials.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Because of your exemplary service to
Her Majesty, you are now officially
an active Field Agent with all the
privileges and responsibilities
thereof.

VANESSA
Thank you, Exposition. I'm honored.

AUSTIN
Congratulations, Field Agent
Kensington!

BASIL EXPOSITION
Austin, I have something for you as
well.

He hands him a business card.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Here's the number of my dentist,
he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll
look after you.

AUSTIN
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties
aren't so bad after all.

VANESSA
Oh, Austin.

Austin and Vanessa embrace and kiss.

BASIL EXPOSITION
Austin, now, about your next mission--

Still kissing Vanessa, Austin motions with his thumbs to the
pilot of the helicopter to lift Basil up. He rises away in
mid-sentence.

BASIL EXPOSITION
(rising up)
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh,
and Austin--

AUSTIN
(calling out)
Yes Basil?

BASIL EXPOSITION
(rising)
Be careful!

Austin and Vanessa kiss again. The helicopter blows them
around.  The CAMERA TILTS UP to the sky and continues to
rise, until we are in--

EXT. SPACE

We see DR. EVIL'S CAPSULE in orbit around the Earth.

DR. EVIL (V.O.)
I'll get you yet, Austin Powers!

INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY

A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
BRUCE
Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
This is a bad sign.
(calling out)
We really need to get a make-up
person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
ALLY
Not in the budget. And not to                         *
*
worry, you're going to look great
in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.
BRUCE
A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
net. I just did the hair.
ALLY
(matter of fact)
Health code. In the kitchen or
around the cookie, you gotta have
it.
BRUCE
(to crew: re hair net)
You guy's should tell me this
before hand, this is like a huge
waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
BRUCE
Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.

2.



ALLY
You're a thing of beauty.     In
three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
BRUCE
For three decades the Kowolski
Family Bakery has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo. Known for
their sinfully rich, cream filled,
deep fried polski pierogis. And
the occasional sugar induced coma
that follows. Today, in honor of
their 30 year anniversary, Momma
Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
Vol, decided to do something, a
little bit different. Tell me
guys, how did this idea come about?

GUSTOV
Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
don't    we make the biggest chocolate
chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
said,    'Yeah, sure.'
BRUCE
Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
BRUCE
The previous Buffalo cookie record
was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
cookie clearly proving that Gustov
and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
As we witness the ceremonial
toasting with milk it makes one
pause and think. What are we
really looking at here?
(MORE)

3.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Is it just a big cookie or does
this cookie represent the pride of
Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
working citizens the key
ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
in.
(motions his eyes to the
Kowolski twins)
And finally, the love of our
families which provides the warm
chewy center making our beloved
Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
And that's the way the cookie
crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
BRUCE
So, what do you think?
GRACE
It's good.
BRUCE
It sucks. It's a story about a
cookie. People with eating
disorders will be riveted,
(goes into huge pathetic
fan character)
Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
I can't wait to vomit so I can make
room for more cookies.
GRACE
I thought it was funny. I love the
hair net. How'd you get it to do
that?

4.



BRUCE
What? I'm cutting that. They made
me wear that stupid thing. I don't
even look like myself. The hair is
one of the most important parts of
an on camera persona. Right out of
the gate, I lost the hair
advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,
GRACE
Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.
BRUCE
Grace. Try to stay focused here.
I need your help.
GRACE
Aren't you taking this a little too
seriously?
BRUCE
It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
There's an anchor job open. This
is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
GRACE
I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.
BRUCE
(sighs)
I'm never going to get anchor doing
these kind of assignments. I want
my work to matter.
GRACE
It does matter. You're funny. You
make people smile. Come on, take a
break, help me put this album
together.

BRUCE
(reluctant)
Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.
GRACE
Oh look at this. It's the first
day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
BRUCE
(down)
Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
GRACE
Oh, here's me at my sister's
wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
BRUCE
You look pretty intense, hun.
GRACE
Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.
BRUCE
So, you're attracted to me in some
way, is that what you're trying to
say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
GRACE
You have no idea.
BRUCE
I was saving myself for the wedding
night, but if you keep this up, I
may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
GRACE
Well, that's the way the cookie
crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

6.



BRUCE
Hey, that's a good line, but you
need more resonance. From the
diaphragm.
(newscaster voice)
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
GRACE
Oh, say it again.
BRUCE
(bigger)
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
GRACE
(sweet, southern groupie)
Oh, I just love on-air
personalities.
BRUCE
(newscaster voice)
Well then, let me take these
clothes off and slip into my hair
net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
GRACE
Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.
BRUCE
No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
SPORTSCASTER

Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.
BRUCE
"And that's the way the cookie

You know, I think there might be
something to that cookie line.
Everything great anchor has his own
signature sign-off.

Peeing in the corner on the carpet.

BRUCE
Oh no!   Grace, the dog!
GRACE (O.S.)
I'm in the shower!
BRUCE
Ah!
INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
BRUCE
Whoops, sorry.
EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
BRUCE
Oh, you're all done, huh?
B-e-a-utiful.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING
Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
GRACE
Wow, nice car, huh?
BRUCE
Yeah, if you want to rub your
success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
BRUCE
What's with the hubbub?
GRACE
We're having a blood drive.
BRUCE
Creepy. Needles, yech...
GRACE
Oh, that's a nice response.

9.



BRUCE
I mean, it's just s o . . .
GRACE
Helpful and life saving?
BRUCE
C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
in your body and I don't think it's
supposed to come out. Besides,
they stockpile that stuff. They
have an endless supply frozen in a
warehouse somewhere then tell
everyone there's a shortage.

GRACE
They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *
giving. I have a very rare blood                     *
type, AB positive.
BRUCE
Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
they aint touchin' me with no
needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
GRACE
(suddenly remembers
something)
O. . .
h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
BRUCE
What's that?
GRACE
Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
Keep you safe.
BRUCE
Well, I hope they work, cause it's
going take a miracle to get me to
work on time.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

10.



A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.
BRUCE
This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.
BRUCE.
The meeting's starting, perfect...
(thinks)
Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
BRUCE
(laughs)
Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
kill or be killed, only the strong
survive, no guts, no glory1
SFX: SIREN
Bruce pulls over, fumes.
BRUCE
(looking heavenward)
Thank you.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:
R EWE BLIND?
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.

BOBBY
Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
Don't even move, I got somethin'
special today. My mom made it just
for you.
BRUCE
Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
I'm late...
BOBBY
(bending down)
You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
BOBBY
You know, contrary to popular
belief the quiche was actually
invented by the Mayans, then stolen
by the French. They shoulda said,
"Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.
BRUCE
Bobby, I can't, I--
BOBBY
Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
BRUCE
Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
BOBBY
That's a buck seventy-five.
BRUCE
Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
BOBBY
(excited)
Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
five, two-ten...

12.



Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
BOBBY
Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
BOBBY
You know, I saw them editing your
cookie piece.

BRUCE
Really?

BOBBY
They must have gotten high or
something, cause they was orderin'
everything, I had. Hey, how long
have you been interested in pastry?
'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
baklava twenty layers deep.

BRUCE
(holding money out)
Bobby.
BOBBY
(gets a brilliant idea)
Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
BRUCE
Keep the change.
BOBBY
(calling after)
I'll give her a call, we'll talk
about it later!
INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY

ON THE MONITOR:

EVAN
Is something killing your kids?
Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

13.



IN THE ROOM
The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.

JACK
Okay, promos are approved, let's--
ALLY
Ah, isn't that last one a little
misleading? I mean, the story's
about flu shots. Do we have to
scare people to death?
EVAN
No, just into watching. Or I could
change it to: "Slow news day, come
yawn with us. At eleven."
FRED
Sniffles at eleven is nice.
DALLAS
Attack of the killer sniffles?
ALLY
(to Dallas)
The tanning booth is starting to
zap your brain, you know that?
DALLAS
I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.
FRED                                        *
Come on. You're turning orange.                       *
EVAN                                        *
He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *
More laughs.                                                    *

JACK
I would have swore I already said
this, but promos are approved. Now                  *
can we move on?                                     *
ALLY
Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
focusing on Pete's retirement.
This is his last week.
EVAN
(leading)
Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
anchor position, Jack?
JACK
Evan, you'11 know something when I
know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
BRUCE
Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
The traffic was -- You guys already
played the spots?
JACK
Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
with Evan's piece on the sex
scandal at the mayor's office for
sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
EVAN
And that's the way the cookie
crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
EVAN
I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
See you've got to remember that the
news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.
BRUCE
(re: Evan's perfect
posture)
That's great Evan.
(MORE)

15.

BRUCE (cont'd)
Is you're posture naturally that
good, or do you have to shove a
stick up there?
JACK
Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
holding your story in reserve.
Now, can we get back to the board
so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.
BRUCE
Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you
for a second?
JACK
Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
BRUCE
Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
BOBBY
Don't worry about it.    I called my
aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
BRUCE
Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
getting desperate man, I am pushing
forty and what have I got to show
for it? The point is, I've hit
some kind of a ceiling here. Some
kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
He gets the good stories, he gets
on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
like Evan.

JACK
You don't want to be like Evan.
Evan's an asshole.
BRUCE
I can be an asshole.

16.



JACK
No, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
JACK
Are you going to pick that up?
BRUCE
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
BRUCE
It's just- this anchor position
looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.
JACK                               BRUCE
Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
JACK
Look, Bruce. You're a good
reporter. You make people laugh.
God knows today we can use it.
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *
JACK                                    *
(beat)
Alright, tell you what. It's the                   *
23rd anniversary of the Maid of the
Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls
in an hour.
BRUCE
Maid of the Mist. That's always
live.
JACK
Yep.
BRUCE
Evan gets the live feeds.

17.



JACK
Well now you and Evan get the live
feeds.
BRUCE
I'm going live. In sweeps.
JACK
Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.
I've seen your outtakes.
Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
BRUCE
Yes 1 You will not regret this,
Jack.
(releases Jack)
I will not forget you when I go
national.
Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his
chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS...
INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY

A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business,
a one room day care center filled with children and toys.
Grace turns, reacts.
GRACE
Martin, are you eating the glitter
again?
ON MARTIN - AN ADORABLE HISPANIC BOY
He shakes his head "no."

GRACE
Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su

He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.
GRACE
Oh, you're not huh? Well, then
you've got a bad case of Liberace.
Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's

ZOE

GRACE
They didn't teach you Spanish in
nursing school, did they?
DEBBIE
Well, it seemed like they were
speaking a foreign language
sometimes, but no. Problemo?
GRACE
Martin has decided to explore new
food groups.
(back to Martin)
Martin, this is for art. Like this.
She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.
DEBBIE
Is it so wrong to tie them up?
GRACE
D eb -- Ma rt i n!
Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.
Grace snatches it.
GRACE
Okay, go rinse your mouth with
water. Lave su boca. Go.

I swear that kid is going to poop
an ornament.
DEBBIE

You're good with them, you know.
You should have some of your own.

BRUCE (cont'd)
They're seeing if I can think on my
feet, like you might have to do in
a live news anchor situation.
GRACE
Oh, my gosh.
BRUCE
This is happening for us, Grace.
What we've always talked about.
Jack practically came out and told
me.
Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-
celebration before.
GRACE
Wait, what do you mean practically?
BRUCE
Well, he didn't spell it out, but
this is exactly what happened to
Susan Ortega right before she was
bumped up to the desk.
GRACE
(being cautious)
I just want to make sure we're not
getting too ahead of ourselves.
BRUCE
I totally agree, but in the mean
time you should start thinking
about what coast you want to live
on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.
BRUCE
Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go.
GRACE
Good luck, honey. I love you.                          *

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places
his ear piece.
ALLY
They want you close to the falls.
BRUCE
What for? I'll get soaked.
ALLY
That's the point.    They want you to
hold up this.
She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped
UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA.
ALLY
Part of the condition of us getting
the exclusive.
Bruce takes the umbrella.
'     '               BRUCE
Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes.
ALLY

Ignore umbrella. Just have fun.
CUT TO:

THE LIVE FEED IN THE CAMERA TRUCK AT THE FALLS

Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.

ON TV

Pete Fineman is reporting.
PETE FINEMAN
...but because of the fast response
by our local fire fighters, the
toxic chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:
SUSAN
Bruce Nolan is standing by at
Niagara Falls with a report on the
Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
but before we go live to Bruce, we
have an announcement to make. As
everyone knows, after 33 years, our
beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
SUSAN
Pete's shoes are virtually
impossible to fill, but the show
must go on. And we could think of
no one better than our very own
Evan Baxter.
ON BRUCE

Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.

23.


SUSAN
Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
we'll be sitting side by side from
now on.
EVAN
Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
honored. Like you said, no one can
replace the great Pete Fineman, but
I'll do my best. I have to say I
am so proud to be a part of our
local community. Of Buffalo. I
think a great city is a lot like a
great recipe really. Put in some
hard working citizens, add some
care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
EVAN (CONT'D)
All sprinkled with the strength and
love of our good families, that
ultimately creates a sweet place to
live. Thank you.
SUSAN
(touched)
Wow. That was amazing. And now
let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.

First off, "I want to add another
congratulations to Evan Baxter.
It's good to see what someone with
real talent can accomplish when
great opportunities are given to
him instead of me.
(still smiling)
Anyway, I'm here, I believe with
Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me,
why did you toss the blue "heart of
the ocean" jewel over the railing
of Titanic?
The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.
BRUCE
Did you feel guilty at all letting
Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you
were safe floating on the big door?
Do you think he would have survived
if you had taken turns, or were you
too afraid to freeze your big fat
ass off?
INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack rockets back into the room.

JACK
Did I just hear..?
BRUCE
Well, I guess that's the way life
works, isn't it? Some people are

Bill shakes his head "NO" as Bruce pulls him into frame.
BRUCE
Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid
of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me,
why do you think I didn't get the
anchor job?
BILL
Hey, man, I don't want any--
BRUCE
Do you think it's my hair?
(Bruce messes his hair
like crazy)
Maybe my teeth aren't white enough?
Or like the great falls, is the
bedrock of my life slowly erroding

Erroding. Erroooding.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions
spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
BRUCE
Hey, come on guys. What are you
doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.
BRUCE
Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.
Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the
word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.

Thank God you're alright.
BRUCE
God, yeah. Let's thank God.
Thanks for everything, Lord. I am
so honored that my horrible demise
is a part of your loving and
mysterious plan.
GRACE
Bruce, don't talk like that.
BRUCE
Oh, don't worry, he's not
listening. If he is he doesn't
care. Have you seen the news
lately? We got gangs, we got
drugs, we got corruption. What
kind of God lets that happen?
Every time we cure a disease he
comes up with a new one!
(goes into God character)
Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's
God. They've just come up with a
treatment for syphilis down there.
I think it's time to release the
tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
guy in Ohio who's praying for
strength and wisdom, blind him and
cut off his legs.
GRACE
So God is torturing us?
BRUCE
Think about it, Grace. God is all-
powerful . He could fix everything
in five minutes if he wanted to.

GRACE
Bruce, please. This isn't his
fault.
BRUCE
Of course not.
(hushed tone)
It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.
GRACE
Honey, you're mad right now. It's
understandable. And what Evan did
was slimy and wrong. But your job
doesn't matter to me. You matter
to me. You could've really been
hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.

BRUCE
Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
And I'm not okay with the fact that
you think everything is okay. I'm
not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
not okay with a mediocre apartment.
I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
GRACE
Is that what you have, Bruce?
A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
for being a piece in your mediocre
puzzle.
BRUCE
Terrific. I'm drowning and you
throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.

Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.

It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
His frustration is turning to desperation.

Okay, God. You want me to talk to

do? Give me a sign...
Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't
notice. . .
BRUCE
I'm right here. Speak to me.
A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of

SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE!

Bruce is oblivious.

Oh well, I guess you don't care.
Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.
BRUCE
Okay, we'll do it your way.
(pulls the beads from the
mirror)
Lord, I need a miracle. Please
help me.

He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.        Bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...
BRUCE
Come on, where'd you go?
(holds them up in triumph)
Ah ha! AHHH!
And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.

EXT. STREET - LAKE EERIE - CONTINUOUS
Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,
challenging the Infinite.
BRUCE
Okay, if that's the way you want
it. The gloves are off, pal! Let
me see a little wrath! Smite me oh
mighty smiteri What, no pestilence
no boils? Come on, you got me on

be fired! The only one around here
not doing his job is YOU! What are
we, you're little pet project? A
hobby you tinker with now and
again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
BRUCE
Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.

The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .

Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.

32.



BRUCE
Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM

A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:
"I LOVE YOU.    WE NEED TO TALK.

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the

Oh, no.

A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS

Denied that promotion at work? Is
life unfair? Everywhere you turn
is there someone less talented than
you reaping all the benefits ? Is
your name Bruce? Then do we have
the job for you. We're located at

Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
So come on down, or we'll just keep
beepin' ya.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
BRUCE
Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.

Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
JANITOR
Want me to even those up for you?

34.


BRUCE
(feigns a smile)
How would I get to room 7?
JANITOR
That'd be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.
BRUCE
What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
JANITOR
Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.
JANITOR
You mind giving me a hand with this
floor?
BRUCE
What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.

SEVENTH FLOOR

The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
BRUCE
Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
looking for whoever runs this
joint...
MAN (O.S.)
Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.

BRUCE
Yep, seems to be.
(wiping his eyes)
Kinda bright, though.

35.



An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
MAN (O.S.)
Yeah, it is for most people. They
spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
. . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put
everything together.
BRUCE
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
JANITOR
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
BRUCE
You installed a clapper?
JANITOR
Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.
(sings)
CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP
OFF. THE CLAPPER.
(claps twice)
You can't get it out of your head.
BRUCE
I gotta go.
JANITOR
Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.
JANITOR
You must be Bruce. I've been
expecting you.
BRUCE
Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
the boss and the electrician and
the janitor.

36.



JANITOR
Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
sleeves, son. People underestimate
the benefits of good 'ol manual
labor. There's freedom in it.
Happiest people in the world stink
like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
JANITOR
Your father knew that. He was a
damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.
BRUCE
How do you know my father? And how
did you get my pager number?
JANITOR
Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
Pretty much everything there is to
know. Everything you've ever said,
done or thought about doin', is
right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
BRUCE
(sarcastic)
Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
Mind if I take a look?
JANITOR
It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE
FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --
The Janitor casually pulls a file.
JANITOR
Now this last entry was a little
disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.
JANITOR
(reads, scanning)
Thanks for everything, Lord.
(MORE)

37.

JANITOR (cont'd)
I am so honored that my horrible
demise is a part of your loving and
mysterious plan.. The gloves are
off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
smiter.
(aside)
I'm not much for blaspheming but
that one made me laugh. Oh, and
let's not forget "What kind of a
God would let this happen? I mean,
have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. ·
BRUCE
Who are you?
JANITOR
I'm the creator of the heavens and
the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.
The first and the last.
BRUCE
Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
JANITOR/GOD
I'm God, Bruce.
BRUCE
Oh, you're God. Well that explains
everything1 That's how you know
everything about me. That's how
you got up to the seventh floor so
quickly.
(placating)
Well, it's really nice to meet you.
Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
BRUCE
Okay, I don't know how you're doing
that, but I really gotta go. This
place is obviously rigged in some
way. We're on some freaky hidden
camera show.
(playing to the "cameras")
...for which I will not sign a
release, by the way! But you know
what, I'd be a little more
impressed if you didn't use the
cheesy file cabinet illusion.
(MORE)

38.

BRUCE      (cont'd)
Everyone with a      brain in their head
would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
normal back.
BRUCE
Okay.     That's good.   That's a good
one.
Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
BRUCE
Okay, God. How many fingers am I
holding out?
Bruce extends three fingers.
GOD
Three.
He quickly pulls one finger in.
GOD
Two.
Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a
beat.
GOD
Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
BRUCE
Okay, how about now.
He quickly pulls in two fingers.
GOD
Seven.

.BRUCE
AH HAl
Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS
ON HIS ONE HAND.

BRUCE
AAAHHHl

39,



He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.
GOD
You've been doing a lot of
complaining about me, Bruce. And
quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.
BRUCE
You stay away from me! I don't
know what your doing. But whatever
you're doing is probably
actionable!
GOD
Well, that's not very neighborly.
I brought you here to offer you a
job.
BRUCE
Job? Wh at job?
GOD
My job. You think you can do it
better, so here's your chance.
When you leave this building you
will be endowed with all my powers.
BRUCE
Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
GOD
All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.
EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce barrels out of the building --
BRUCE
Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --

40.



BRUCE
No.

He races on.

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
BRUCE
I'm having a breakdown. That's
what it is. Just a normal,
everyday psychotic episode, brought
on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
BRUCE
(to the car)
Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.
BRUCE
(denial)
Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.
MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"

EXT. CITY STREETS

Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
BRUCE
Okay, just relax here. I did not
meet God and I do not have his
powers.
(laughs)
If that was God, then I'm Mario
Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
BRUCE
AAAHHHHHHHH!J!

41.


Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.
PAUL NEWMAN
Hey Mario, did you get that box of
dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
BRUCE
(in perfect Italian)
Si, dovete venire sopra per il
pranzo un certo tempo.
(SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
come over for dinner some
time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.
PIT CREW
Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
INT. DINER - DAY
Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
BRUCE
It isn't real, it isn't real, it
isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
BRUCE
Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.

42.



WAITRESS
We've got a special on soup today.

BRUCE
No, that's okay.
WAITRESS
It's tomato.
BRUCE
Alright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
BRUCE
Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
BRUCE
That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
WAITRESS
I lie to my sister.
BRUCE
What?
WAITRESS
(becoming emotional)
And I'm sleeping with my best
friend's husband. I know he's just
using me but.. I'm just so tired of
being alone. I don't know why I'm
telling you all this. Just seems
like you'd understand.
BRUCE
Okay.

43.



WAITRESS
(sets the check down)
Take care of that whenever you're
ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME

The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
GOD (O.S.)
Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
BRUCE
You- He- Thy...
GOD
Let's take a walk.
EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
GOD
(re: the cockroach)
Most people want to kill these
guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
streamlined design. Like little
armored tanks. Y'know, they can
hold their breath for forty minutes
and their cells divide only once
per molting cycle creating a
cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
that...
(catching himself)
Oh, this is a bit over your head,
isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.

44.



GOD
Okay, let me explain the rules.
BRUCE
Rules ?
GOD
Yeah, you left in such a rush I
didn't get a chance to explain.
BRUCE
Well the two extra fingers freaked
me out a little bit.
GOD
(laughs)
I figured that would get your
attention.. I did the same thing to
Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
have all my power. Use it any way
you choose. There are only two
rules. You can't tell anyone
you're God. Believe me you don't
want that kind of attention. And
you can't mess with free will.
BRUCE
Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?
GOD
(excited)
Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.
BRUCE
This is amazing.
GOD
Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.

45.



GOD
Since you're finished with these, I
think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
in handy someday.
WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE

God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.
GOD
I'll be seein' ya.
BRUCE
Where are you going?
GOD
I'm taking a vacation.
BRUCE
God can't take a vacation. Can he?
Can you?
GOD
Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
everything in five minutes if you
want to, right?
ON BRUCE
BRUCE
...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
GRACE
(re: magazine)
Gosh, this girl is so talented and
all they ever talk about is her
hair.

46.



DEBBIE
Yeah, she should marry somebody
famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.
DEBBIE
We would have heard it ring.
GRACE
I know. It's just that he usually
calls during the day.
DEBBIE
He just needs to blow off some
steam, he'll be fine.
GRACE
I hope so. I've never seen him                        *
that mad. An d I lashed back--                        *
DEBBIE
Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
I'm impressed.
GRACE
I feel bad for him.   He's wanted
anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
DEBBIE
Well, I've been praying to win the
lottery for fifteen years, but it's
not going to happen. You know,
it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.
CLERK
That'll be four hundred and twenty-
seven, eighty.-
DEBBIE
What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.
DEBBIE
Zoe.
(to Clerk)
(MORE)

47.

DEBBIE (cont'd)
Hang on, I might need you to un-
check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.
GUY IN LINE
Come on, lady.
DEBBIE
(snaps)
Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.
GRACE
Listen, I better get back. I want
to be there for him.
DEBBIE
You're a saint, Grace.
GRACE
What can I say, I love him. And if
I know Bruce, he's out there
wandering around with the weight of
the world on his shoulders.

CUT T0:

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK
Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
BRUCE
And he saw that it was good.
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
BRUCE
B-e-a-utifull

48.


EXT. ALLEY

Bruce approaches the gang.
BRUCE
Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.
HOOD #1
Oh look, it's the hero.
HOOD #2
Hungry for another can of whoop-
ass?
HOOD #3
Your stereo sounds great in my car,
man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
BRUCE
Look, I don't want to fight you
guys. So as soon as you apologize,
I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.
HOOD #1
Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
BRUCE
What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
BIG GUY
Did that come out of your butt,
man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.
BRUCE
Now I'm going to have to teach the
rest of you guys a lesson.

49.



HOOD #2
Yeah, you and whose army?
BRUCE
Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.
BRUCE
And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.
BRUCE
PILE ON THE RABBIT1
T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --

Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --
ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT

Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
HOOD #2
Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
BRUCE
Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.
BRUCE
I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A
SWARM OF LOCUSTS --

50.



EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN
LOCUSTS.
Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down
to the monkey.
BRUCE
Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.
HOOD #1
NoI   NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.
ON BRUCE
He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE

We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.
BRUCE
I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
MY WILL BE DONE I
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.
GRACE
(to Sam)
Well, at least I have someone to
drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

51.



BRUCE
What if God was one of us. . .
Just a slob like one of us...
Just a stranger on a bus...
Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
BRUCE
(finishing song)
...home.
GRACE
(re: the flowers)
Oh, my God.
BRUCE
You can call me Bruce.
GRACE
Where have you been? You're
so...happy.
BRUCE
Who wouldn't be on a night like
this?
(holding out the flowers)
For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
GRACE
These are amazing. What are they?
BRUCE
It's a totally new breed. A cross
pollination between tulips and
Daisies. I call them Todayzees.
GRACE
Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
GRACE
Bruce, is there something you're
not telling me?

52.


BRUCE
Nothing of this world. Why?
GRACE
What do you mean, why? Last night
you weren't exactly happy with
life.
BRUCE
Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he
passes.
BRUCE
CD 4, Track 7.
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.
EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE
CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.
CUT TO:
OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON
Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.
BACK TO SCENE
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
GRACE
Wow, it really cleared up. I've
never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.

53.



BRUCE
We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.
BRUCE
Bedroom.
GRACE
Five minutes.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.
GRACE
I'11 be out in a minute.
BRUCE (O.S.)                                *
Don't rush yourself. Sometimes                        *
anticipation can heighten the                         *
pleasure.                                             *
Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *
brushing, picks up her lipstick.                             *
BRUCE (O.S.)                             *
It's a funny thing about, pleasure.                   *
GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *
her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *
herself.                                                    *
BRUCE (O.S.)                             *
It can be extremely pleasurable.                      *
Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *
out of frame to the ground.                                *
GRACE                                    *

CUT TO:            *

54.



BRUCE
Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
ON TV - THE MORNING NEWS
MORNING REPORTER
In international news, Japanese
relief workers are staging a
desperate effort to rescue hundreds
of people stranded by a freak tidal
wave that hit Kitamoto City...
We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted
from root tops.
MORNING REPORTER
Scientists say the tsunami may have
been caused by what they're
describing as "unusual lunar
activity." More on this, as it
develops. . .
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
ANGLE - SAM
Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.
BRUCE
Sam. Uh uh uh.

55.



Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS
TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,
WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at
Bruce.

BRUCE
Good boy.

INT. KITCHEN

Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.
BRUCE
Good morning.
GRACE
(gushy-lovey, sing songy)
Good morning. Cooked you grilled
cheese.
BRUCE
Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.
GRACE
Last night was just...
BRUCE
Heavenly?
GRACE
Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
GRACE
It's funny, but when I woke up this
morning, It felt like my boobs were
bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
GRACE
(holding them up)
Do they look bigger to you?
BRUCE
Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
same to me.

56.


They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.
GRACE
They're definitely bigger.      They
feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.
BRUCE
You got me. Probably just a
hormonal thing.
(takes a quick final bite)
Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
gotta run.
GRACE
Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.
BRUCE
To get my job back.
MUSIC UP:
EXT. BRUCE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling
"What if God were One of Us."
INT. BRUCE'S CAR

CLOSE ON - BRUCE
He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by
on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window.
TEENAGER
(sincerely impressed)
Wow, nice car man.
BRUCE
Well, it gets me from A to B.
MASTER - STREET
Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new MERCEDES 2003 VISION
SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE and peels
out.

57.


EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic. No
problem, the traffic magically opens up for him, cars
instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for Bruce.
He waves as he passes.
BRUCE
And the last shall be first.
EXT. POLICE TRAINING CENTER - DAY

A POLICE DOG, HANK, performs some standard TAKE DOWNS by
"attacking" a "criminal" (trainer) on the run. PHIL, a
reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story.
PHIL
I certainly wouldn't want to be a
fugitive on the run with Hank,
Buffalo's number one police dog, on
the job. This is Phil Sidleman
reporting from The Police Canine
Training center.
(beat)
And cut it. Let's go, guys.
The crew start to wrap up.
ANGLE - BRUCE
Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video
camera. Phil spots him.
PHIL
Hey, channel seven, right? You're
the guy that went crazy.
BRUCE
Yeah, I had a bad day. But things
are lookin' up.
PHIL
What are you doin' here?
BRUCE
Just lookin' for a story.
PHIL
(waving the video tape)
Well, this pond's fished out.
Pretty standard stuff anyway.

58.


BRUCE
I don't know. My instinct tells me
there's something more.
PHIL
Well, go with that. It's served
you well in the past, right?
Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

TRAINER (O.S.)
Hey, Hank found something1

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES
ARE UNCOVERE D IN THE DI RT. Hank BARKS.

POLICEMAN
We got a bodyI

PHIL
(to his crew)
Shit. Get the camera, now!

EXTREME CLOSE ON - THE VAN'S DOOR LOCK

DAN RATHER
The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
uncovered in a field today outside
of a canine training center in
Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
freelance field reporter Bruce
Nolan was the first on the scene...

59.


We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.
BRUCE
Since the disapearence of Teamster
president Jimmy Hoffa in the
nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
have remained one of this country's
great unsolved mysteries. That is
until just moments ago, when during
a routine training session, a
police dog named Hank sniffed his
way right into the history books.
As you can see behind us, the body
is being carefully exhumed and will
be transported to a hospital
facility where DNA testing will
confirm the identity. That, of
course, only a formality as in a
bizarre twist, the body was found
buried with a birth certificate and
complete set of dental records.
(rubs Hank's neck)
Sort of a two-in-one for Hank
today, as moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew with four
kilo's of marijuana.
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.

As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING
SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS
TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:
"HEAVEN IS AT HAND.   LEGGO YOUR EGGO."

Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.

Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Hi, Bruce.

BRUCE
(surprised)
Oh, Susan.. Hi.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Good work, I'm impressed.
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit
inflated by the encounter.
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.
BOBBY

I hear Jack wants to see you.
BRUCE
That's the word.
BOBBY
You're going to need your energy in

donut?
BRUCE
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.
BOBBY

BRUCE
No.
BOBBY

Spiralina?
BRUCE
I'm really not interested.

BOBBY
Yeah, I don't blame 'ya, they taste
like grass.
Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.

BOBBY
Tell you    what? I wasn't going to
break it    open until lunch time, but
I made a    batch of rhubarb that you
have got    to try.
BRUCE
Bobby, I--
BOBBY
Come on, it's my mother's recipe
she's practically cripple...
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.
BRUCE
No, I really- no...
BOBBY
Open up, that's it, here comes the
news chopper...

BRUCE
No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I
didn't want anything.

Damn you...
Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL
THE WAR AROUND,    THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP
FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.
FEMALE OFFICE WORKER
Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that

She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.

any spare oxygen in there.

going to propose, do you?

I don't think anything.

You do. You think he's going to

Well, sure.

Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they

leave. Grace is clearly upset.
GRACE
You have lipstick on your face.
BRUCE
Oh, thanks...
GRACE
Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
we had an understanding--
Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
BRUCE
Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
GRACE
What are you talking about? It's
not loud.
The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.

He gets up and darts off.

Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH
MOUNTAIN PEAK.
GOD (O.S.)
Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.
BRUCE
Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.
GOD
It's Everest. You should try
flipping on the Discovery Channel
every now and then. Well, I guess
you can't now, being dead and all.
BRUCE
I'm dead?I
God laughs.

76.



GOD
No, I'm just messing with you.
BRUCE
Those voices...
GOD
They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
ignoring them and they're going to
build up on. you like that. You
didn't think being God was going to
be all fun and games did you?
BRUCE
Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
GOD
You aren't listening, son. Let's
see, you've had my powers for over
a week now and how many people have
you helped?
BRUCE
Okay, so maybe I've righted a
couple of the wrongs in my own
life. I was going to get around to
others. I can do both. I can help
the world.
GOD
The world? That wasn't the world,
Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
between Commonwealth and 57th.
Didn't want to start you out with
more than you can handle. Now how
you doing otherwise? Personal life
in good shape?
BRUCE
Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.
GRACE
Bruce? What are you doing out
here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.

BRUCE
Oh, ah,

She can't...
(God shakes his head, back
to Grace)
I just, ah, needed a little fresh
air.
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
GRACE
Bruce, what is going on? The
second I want to talk about us you
run out on me.
GOD
(to Bruce)
Everything's great, huh?
BRUCE
I wasn't running out on you...
GRACE
You know, I actually had the crazy
idea that you were going to ask me
to marry you tonight.
GOD
Now it's heating up.
BRUCE

You are not helping.

...me at all here, Grace.
GOD
(sarcastic)
Nice recovery.
Bruce looks to God to shut up.
GRACE
Not helping you what?
BRUCE
(to Grace)
Look hun, I want to talk about
this. This just isn't a good time.
Okay?

GRACE
When is it a good time? It's never
a good time.
GOD
She's got a point.
BRUCE
(to God)
Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.

GRACE
Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.
BRUCE
Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
GOD
You're going to have to answer
those things, y'know.
GRACE

Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.
BRUCE
(to God)
Thank you.
GOD
You want some friendly advice?
BRUCE
No.
God smiles.

GRACE
Okay, this is getting ridiculous I
Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.
GRACE
I have to see a doctor. There's

Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...
BRUCE
No.     You look great.
GRACE
I look like a hooker I My whole
body is changing.
She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick
out.
GRACE
My back didn't used to arch like

GRACE
No, I'm not.
Bruce looks over Grace's shoulder and ADJUSTS THE CLOCK FORTY
MINUTES FORWARD. Grace turns and is surprised.
GRACE
Oh my goshI How did I sleep this
late? I've got to run. Are you
giving me a ride?

Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.

We'll have the money. Listen to me
closely. I'm getting anchor.
Then, I'm going to get spotted,
offers will come flooding in to go

Mission accomplished.                           *
BRUCE
Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
GRACE
Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's                  *

accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *
PARTIERS
There he is. . . The manI.. All
hail our new anchor!I
BRUCE
Bless you. Bless you.
PARTYING SPORTS GUY
Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
game tonight?
BRUCE
Put your money on the Sabers.
Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.

FRENCH WAITER
Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
ordered, sir. And the people are
hungry.
BRUCE
What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.
FRENCH WAITER
Only three chips and two shrimp.
BRUCE
(confident)
Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.
CUT TO:
CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS
REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.

The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.

93.



CROWD
Speech!   Speech!!   Speech!

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
BRUCE
I ' d thank you all for coming, but
the liquor is free so maybe you
should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.

BRUCE
And now let me tell you a story.
There was a man who had two sons.
The younger son took his
inheritance and squandered his
money on a life of lust and
debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hey there.

Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
SUSAN
Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
here all alone?
BRUCE
Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.

SUSAN
Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
love the new place, by the way. So
how are you and Grace doing?
BRUCE
I don't know, we had a fight
earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
things are different now and...

94.



SUSAN
You're on fire Bruce. Some women
can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.
SUSAN
You know, I always had an instinct
about you. I knew you were going
to make something of yourself.
BRUCE
Really?
SUSAN
There's something special about you
Bruce. I like special...
BRUCE
Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.
ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

Grace and Debbie enter.

DEBBIE
So this is your new place, huh?
GRACE
Cozy, don't you think? Come on
help me find him.
They head into the room.
DEBBIE
You sure you want to do this?
GRACE
I don't know. It's his big night.                      *
I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *
how much this means to him.                            *
DEBBIE                                      *
*
So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.
GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.

95.



DEBBIE
Oh, boy.

Bruce turns and sees Grace.
BRUCE
Grace, I...
GRACE
. (fighting back tears)
Get the car, Deb.
DEBBIE
Right.

BRUCE
Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.
EXT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
Bruce follows Grace outside.
BRUCE
Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.
GRACE
Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
don't want your things. . . I don't
want you.
BRUCE
Come on, don't say that. I was
just calling y ou--
GRACE
And you thought Susan's mouth was
the phone?
BRUCE
I didn't think you were coming-- I
mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
Let me make it up to you.
GRACE
How about a boat, Bruce?

BRUCE
If that's what you want.

96.



GRACE
Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
bags of cash, you know, the ones
with the big cartoon dollar signs
on the front. Then I'll be happy.
Because I'm just hollow inside.
Debbie's been right. All this
time. I defended you, told her
there was good in you. Another
side to you. Well, I just saw that
other side and I don't want
anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,
BRUCE
Grace, come on, don't do this.
GRACE
Go back to your little co-anchor.
Or is that ho-anchor?
(tearing)
I came back here to apologize. How
stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.
BRUCE
You're the one that didn't like the
new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.
BRUCE
You can't walk out on me! I'm the
alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.
BRUCE
(desperate last attempt)
I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
BRUCE
Fine! I don't need you! I have
everything I need. Did you hear
that?!
(yelling)
I have EVERYTHING!

97.


INT. UPSCALE HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.
SUSAN
I was right. She couldn't handle
the fire.
*
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.
GOD
Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
like spending time with some real
frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?
BRUCE
Grace left me.
GOD
I know.
BRUCE
(certain)
She'll take me back.
(uncertain)
Will she take me back?
GOD
Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...
BRUCE
How do you make someone love you
when you can't effect free will?
GOD
Welcome to my world, son. You come
up with an answer to that one, you
let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...
CUT TO:

98.



INT. DEBBIE AND MIKE'S HOUSE - MORNING
Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.
JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP
Here's a little ditty,
about Grace and her man Bruce,
two Americans growing up,
needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.    Is she dreaming?
EXT. DEBBIE'S HOUSE
Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.
ON GRACE
notices something    CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in     the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next    tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does     a double take, continues on.
INT. COFFEE SHOP

Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.
INT. SMALL WONDER'S DAY CARE - DAY

Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE (in profile) HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE
HIM."
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - LATER

Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
BRUCE
Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.
BRUCE
Hi.

99.



GRACE
Hi..
BRUCE
I, ah, have my first anchor
tonight.
GRACE
That's great. I hope it goes well
for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.
BRUCE
I miss you.
(off her silence)
I just took the first step, shot
myself out on the ledge, awaiting
vulnerably your response.
GRACE
. . . I don't know what to say.
BRUCE
How about you love me and you'll
take me back.
GRACE
No, Bruce.
BRUCE
Come on, what about all the signs?
GRACE
What? How do you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?
BRUCE
(beat)
Would it help if I told you I acted
like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.
MARTIN
Hey, you said ass.
BRUCE
It's okay as long as you mean a
donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
only bad when you say "ass-ho--

100.


GRACE
Alright, inside, Martin.
(to the others)
Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.
BRUCE
Grace, please. None of this seems                    *
right without you.                                   *
(off her reaction)                               *
Is that a glimmer of hope I see?                     *
GRACE
I have to go...                                      *
She starts off. . .
BRUCE
Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.
BRUCE
Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.
GRACE
...Are you out of your mind? Have
you been drinking?
BRUCE
Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit h
POWER.
Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...
BRUCE
...LOVE ME1!!
GRACE
(a beat)
You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
EXT. SMALL WONDER'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
(from the prison yard) drive off with it.

101.


BRUCE
Hey11   That's my car!!
INT. BRUCE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
The PRISONERS drive off laughing.
PRISONER #1
Ha, nice wheels, huh?
BRUCE sits up in the back seat.
BRUCE
Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.
BRUCE
Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
BRUCE
What is wrong with the world?

JACK
The world's gone mad.
Jack clicks off the monitor. Bruce hustles in from make-up.
An air of forced confidence about him. Nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.
JACK
Oh, there you are. Your big debut.
How you feeling?
BRUCE
You know what? I'm good. The show
must go on.
Bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality.
SUSAN

Bruce, if I had any idea Grace was
going to be there last night...
BRUCE
Susan, you didn't do anything                          *
wrong. In fact, I found the                            *

Okay, the Sabers just won the
Stanley Cup. It's getting pretty

Twenty-three to one, who would have

Aw, geez. Ever since that damn

The power comes back up.
STAGE MANAGER
We're back.

Thank you, Susan--
Susan gets a feed in her earpiece.

I'm sorry, we're going live to Rupp

won the Stanley cup. Fred...
Bruce is noticeably bothered.

INT. SABERS LOCKEROOM.

Fred is with the coach. The team is celebrating, champagne
rains down.
FRED
Thank's Susan. I'm here with coach
Tucker who has lead the Sabers to
their first championship in 22
years...
ON BRUCE'S mounting frustration. He gives a look.
FRED
Tell me coach...
Fred's face registers A PAINED LOOK. He tries to keep it
together. A beat of silence...
FRED '

I have to use the restroom.
He drops the mic and runs out. Off the coach's puzzled
look...

Bruce covers.

Again, STATIC... Jack tosses his headset.

Oh, for the love of Godl What is
it now?
The Stage Manager again listens to his wire.

105.



STAGE MANAGER
The whole booth is down.
CRASH! A BRICK flies through a front window.       Bruce turns to
see...
EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers
going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting
right alongside ordinary citizens.
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against
the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying
cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.
BRUCE
What's going on?
COLLEGE KIDS
Partying, man. Wooooll!!     Sabers I!
They continue to trash the area.
BRUCE
But your team wonl
Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects
himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.
The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.
POLICE OFFICE
Stay down.

BRUCE
Where are the other officers?

POLICE OFFICE
What other    officers? Half the
force just    retired. Said their
"ship came    in." You better get
home pal. I   t's dangerous out here.
The Officer heads out. Bruce stands, then quickly DUCKS, as
a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker
on it.

106.



RIOTE R
The lottery sucks!    I only won 17
bucks i
BACK TO SCENE

Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes CRASHING DOWN. Bruce
looks out over the rioters.
ON BRUCE

We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down
on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN
THE SKY. WIND BLOWS. LIGHTENING CRACKS.

BRUCE
Hear, O' Buffalo, you have awakened
my wrath. Vengeance is mine!
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the
rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as
THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering
mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key
God gave him. He grips it tightly and...
INT. OMNI PRESENTS - NIGHT                                       *

Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him,
mopping. God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him.
BRUCE
They're all out of control. I
don't know what to do.
GOD
You mind giving me a hand with this
floor first?
Off Bruce's look. . .

They finish up.   God looks back at the sparkling floor,
satisfied.
GOD
There we go. Wonderful thing. No
matter how filthy something gets,
it can always be cleaned right up.
God collects Bruce's mop.
BRUCE
What happened? I gave everyone
what they wanted.
God sets the mops down.
GOD
Since when does anyone have a clue
about what they want?
God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the
DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...
GOD
Remember Ginnie?
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.
GOD
Ginnie thought she lost her beauty
when she got older. I'm trying to
convince her otherwise.
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
HER OLDER SELF again.
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL
YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy
Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.
GOD
Ah yes, Filbert. Brilliant young
man. He was going to be a great
poet.

GOD (cont'd)
The soul of his work would have
been built out of his hardships.
He would have touched millions.
(feigns cheery)
But now he's headed for a career as
a professional wrestler.
God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a
lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.
GOD
Ester Maha. I love Ester. Ester
was bankrupt. She was going to
have to eat her pride and call her
sister. Would've got the two of
them together again. Instead, she
bought a condo in Florida.

Wait. Where are you going?

This is good-bye, Bruce. You've

God stops, looks down to Bruce.

thinking.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of
Grace. The bed is made. Empty.
Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier
apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and
despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.
Reaches for a stack of photos...

Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is

Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign

Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.

Suddenly, Filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no
sting. The bigger boy looks down and grins.

INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM
The teacher stands before the class, reading a student's
paper.
TEACHER
"Pain". By Filbert Davis.
As she reads the poem, PAN TO Filbert Davis seated in class
with a ripe BLACK EYE.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Bruce is waiting for Sam to pee.

BRUCE
Come on, Sam. Let's do this the
right way... Oh, alright...
Bruce pulls out a SWATCH OF CARPET, lays it on the grass.
Sam happily goes. They walk off together.
BRUCE
That's not normal you know.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the
counter - all number 6.
BOBBY
(demonic voice)
Do you have these in red?
Bruce walks up behind Bobby.
BRUCE
Okay Bobby, it's time to come back.
Bobby HISSES at Bruce, turns INSANELY DEMONIC.

BOBBY
LEAVE ME HOLY MAN OR I WILL FEED ON
YOUR SOUL!It

BRUCE
(casual)
Un-damn you, Bobby.
Bobby instantly transforms to normal.

112.


BOBBY
Hey thanks, Bruce.
(holds out a cookie)
Biscotti?
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.
EVAN
You're probably here to gloat over
the anchor position. Go ahead, I'm
sure I deserve it.
BRUCE
You know, Evan.    I've been a real
prick.
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.
BRUCE
You were born to anchor. I'm not
taking the position. Oh, and I
never really congratulated you on
getting the job in the first place.
Congratulations, Evan.
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,
there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between
them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER
ON TV

Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
Jack is relieved.
EVAN BAXTER
In the financial world, things are
settling back to normal in what
analysts are calling a fluke market
fluctuation...
Bruce enters.
BRUCE
You made the right choice, Jack.

113.



JACK
So what about you? What will you
do?
BRUCE
With your permission, I think I'll
go out there and make the people
laugh. To quote a friend, "God
knows we could use it."
Jack smiles.
JACK
Permission granted.
Bruce turns to go, then turns back.
BRUCE
Oh, are you hungry? I know a place
that makes a mean tomato soup.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Bruce walks along side Jack. Jack talks and talks, happy to
have the company. Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to..
INT. DINER
Bruce and Jack take a seat at the counter.
WAITRESS (O.S.)
Coffee, gentlemen?
Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant
attraction. Bruce smiles.
BRUCE
Jack. This is a friend of mine,
Cindy. Cindy this is Jack.
JACK                                 CINDY

EXT. EYEWITNESS NEWS STATION - DAY
ON THE HOMELESS SIGN GUY
His sign reads:
"GOD BEE GOOD HONEY"

PULL BACK to reveal BRUCE, sitting next to him with his own
sign reading:
"WHATEVER fl£ SAID"

With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.
BRUCE
You can do it, Sam. Without the
carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.
DEBBIE
(re: the peeing dog)
Looks like your rain dance worked.
BRUCE
Debbie. Hey. You know, I never
got to apologize for--
DEBBIE
I didn't really come to chat, I
came for Grace's things.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT

Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.
DEBBIE
They're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.
DEBBIE
You really hurt her, you know.
BRUCE
I know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.
DEBBIE
You know what I do before I go to
sleep every night? I tuck my kids
in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
and watch Conan.
(MORE)

115.

DEBBIE (cont'd)
You know what Grace does? She
prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.
BRUCE
The woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
"Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
contentment, find You."
"Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
meaning."
"Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.
BRUCE
She still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.
EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT
Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.
GRACE
Please God. Please...

11 6.



Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.
GRACE
Please God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.
GRACE
...but I don't want to love him
anymore. Please God. Help me to
forget.
(cries)
I don't want to hurt anymore. I
want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.
ON GRACE
Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.
BRUCE
You win. I' m done. Please. I
don't want to do this anymore. I
don't want to be God.
(sighs)
Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .
HONK1 HONKI

A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.
FLYING POV

117.



SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.
BRUCE
Am I...?
GOD
You can't expect to kneel down in
the middle of a highway and live to
talk about it.
BRUCE
But why? Why now?
GOD
I work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.
BRUCE
You knew it all along. You knew if
I got everything I wanted, I would
ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.
BRUCE
So I'm dead... Okay. If this is
what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.
GOD
Go ahead, use 'em.
BRUCE
Alright... I've learned that I
don't know as much I thought I
did...
GOD
Boy, you can say that again.
BRUCE
Hey, I'm praying here.

118.


GOD
Sorry, go.
BRUCE
If I could have just one thing in
the world. It would be for Grace
to live a happy, joyful life. And
that she finds someone...
(getting emotional as he
realizes what he's
saying)
...that she finds someone that will
treat her with the love and respect
that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.
GOD
Now that is a prayer.
(beat)
Well, I better get on that one.
See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .
NURSE
He's back!
INTERN
BP 40 over 110 and rising.
DOCTOR #1
(to Bruce) -
Bruce? Can you hear me?
(Bruce nods)
We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.
DOCTOR #1
You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
easy to find a match - you're a
very rare blood type.

119.



Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.
CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACING

BRUCE
(groggy whisper)
A/B Positive...
DOCTOR #2 (O.S.)
You should thank God for donors.
We don't have a lot of that type on
hand.
NURSE
There's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...
GRACE

A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.
GRACE
(re: her swab)
I hear that all of this winds up in
a warehouse somewhere. But you
know me, I'm a sucker for this
stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.
GRACE
I don't even know what I'm doing
here. But... When I heard that
you'd been in an accident and that
you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.
BRUCE
Hey, I'm okay.
GRACE
Does it hurt?
BRUCE
Only when I talk., and smile... and
y'know, exist in general.

120.



Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.
GRACE
Oh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him
GRACE
What is it?
BRUCE
Nothing. It's just really nice to
see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY
A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,
Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,
Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.
BOBBY
You know, French Toast was invented
by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
had a poor knowledge of grammar,
and did not know how to use the
possessive apostrophe, so he called
it French Toast instead of French's
Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.
BRUCE
This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
drive. Remember, the life you save
may be mine, so hurry down. I had
a close call and, well, can you
imagine what life would have been
like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.

121.



BRUCE
In honor of this event, the
Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.
BRUCE
Sure, a little creepy and a
shameless plug, but we love 'em.
(Bruce breaks off a little
piece, takes a bite)
Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
gets more air time than a high
speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.
·
BRUCE
To be honest, I've never been a big
fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.
BRUCE
(nervous)
Okay, we're good to go...They just
stick it into my arm. Breaking
through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:
BRUCE
BLLLAAAA!

Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.
They all laugh.

BRUCE
Had you going, didn't IIIIII1

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs
more.

122.


BRUCE
No, this is nothing. In fact, this
is the second time I've given blood
this week. For those of you who
haven't heard, I ' d like you to meet
the soon to be Mrs. Exclusive.
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.
BRUCE
This is Bruce Nolan reporting for
Eyewitness News.
The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.
BRUCE
So, what'd you think?
GRACE                                      *
I don't know, I thought it was very                   *
pleasurable.                                          *
Bruce smiles, they kiss...
As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:
THEE END
The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and

CUT TO BLACK:
FADE IN:

EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.

LLOYD
Excuse me, can you tell me how to
get to the medical school? I'm
supposed to be giving a lecture in
twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
lost.

YOUNG WOMAN
(heavy European accent)
Go straight aheads and makes a left
over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.

LLOYD
I couldn't help noticing the accent.
You from Jersey?

YOUNG WOMAN
(unimpressed)
Austria.

LLOYD
Austria? You're kidding.
(mock-Australian accent)
Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
we get together later and throw a
few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
(to self)
Guess I won't be going Down Under
tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

2.

INT. LIMO

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

DISPATCHER
(v.o.)
Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

LLOYD
This is 22.

DISPATCHER
22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
You're running late on the East Side
pick-up.

LLOYD
Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
way.

DISPATCHER
(v.o.)
Well hurry it up. And make sure you
park legally. One more ticket and
your ass is history.

CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.

HARRY
Okay, gang, single file. You know
the rules: No pushing, no humping,
and no sniffing heinies...

3.

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.

PALMER
Hey, why aren't those mutts on
leashes?

HARRY
The same reason you're not on a leash,
sir because it's demeaning and it
chafes like hell.

PALMER
Just get them in here now! They all
have to be bathed and clipped in an
hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.

HARRY
You kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

HARRY (CONT'D)
(at truck)
Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.

CUT TO:
EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

MARY
Hello.
(beat)
I'll be just a minute...

4.

As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...

CUT TO:

INT. LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:

LLOYD
Why you going to the airport? Flying
somewhere?

MARY
(dead-pan)
How'd you guess?

LLOYD
Well, I saw your luggage, then when
I noticed the airline ticket, I put
two and two together.
(beat)
So where you heading?

MARY
Aspen.

LLOYD
Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
California's beautiful this time of
year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

MARY
I'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.

LLOYD
Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
It's only temporary.

5.

MARY
Oh?

LLOYD
Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
are saving up our money so we can
open our own pet store.

MARY
That's nice.

LLOYD
(smiling)
I got worms.

MARY
I beg your pardon?

LLOYD
That's what we're gonna call it: I
Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
selling worm farms you know, like
ant farms. A lot of people don't
realize that worms make much better
pets than ants. They're quiet,
affectionate, they don't bite, and
they're super with the kids.

MARY
Aren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

LLOYD
Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
as affectionate. And if you cut an
ant's head off, it won't grow back.

MARY
I see.

LLOYD
And best of all, worm farming is a
seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
industry. I wouldn't mind having a
piece of that pie, if you know what
I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.

6.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What's the matter? Little tense about
the flight?

MARY
(beat)
Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

LLOYD
It's really nothing to worry about,
Mary. Statistically, they say you're
more likely to get killed on the way
to the airport. You know, like in a
head-on crash, or something.

MARY
Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
eyes on the road.

LLOYD
Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

MARY
Here you go.

LLOYD
Keep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
pass out. You'll be there before you
know it.

MARY
Thanks Lloyd.
(beat)
And good luck with your worms.

7.

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.

POLICE OFFICER
Come on, move it, you're in a red
zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

ARMANI SUIT
She's gonna leave the briefcase at
the foot of the escalator. You make
the pick-up.

PLAID SPORTCOAT
Piece of cake.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG.

When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

LLOYD
(to car's driver)
Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.

8.

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.

LLOYD
Damn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.
LLOYD
You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

9.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE

MENTAL).

MENTAL
Who the hell do you figure this guy's
working for?

SHAY
I don't know, but we'd better find
out...

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.

SHAY (CONT'D)
Your ulcer?

MENTAL
It ain't gonna kill me.

INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR

Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
toward the door of their apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

HARRY
I got fired again.

Lloyd shakes his head.

LLOYD
I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
let's face it, you are one pathetic
loser. No offense.

HARRY
None taken. Were you shitcanned,
too?

10.

LLOYD
Of course not.
(beat)
I quit.

HARRY
Why'd you quit?

LLOYD
I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
me.

HARRY
Why didn't you wait and see if your
suspicions were well-founded?

LLOYD
Winners control their own destiny,
Har.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.

HARRY
You know, the thing that really chaps
my ass is that I just spent my life
savings turning my van into a poodle.
(beat)
The alarm alone cost me two hundred.

LLOYD
Big deal. That car's an old bomb
anyway.

HARRY
What are you talking about? It's
only six years old.

LLOYD
That's forty-two in dog years.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
notices the briefcase.

HARRY
What's with the briefcase?

LLOYD
It's a love memento.

HARRY
Huh?

11.

LLOYD
The most beautiful woman alive. Her
name was Mary. I drove her to the
airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
high, breasts heaved. She left this
case in the terminal and flew to
Aspen and out of my life. End of
story.

HARRY
What's in it?

LLOYD
DO you really expect me to go snooping
around in someone else's private
property?

HARRY
Why not?

LLOYD
(beat)
It's locked.

They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a
LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.
The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to
the

PEEPHOLE.

HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental
are standing at the door.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING to Harry)
Friend or foe?

HARRY
(WHISPERING)
We don't have any friends.

Harry is still squinting out the peephole.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Can't recognize them. Could be student
loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
maybe somebody pissed off about that
case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
a check on.

12.

LLOYD
Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
Praline.

HARRY
Well, whoever they are, they look
serious. One of them's even wearing
plaid.

LLOYD
(cringing)
That's a hostile pattern. I say we
bail and get down to unemployment.

Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the
window and down the fire escape.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building
and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.
Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE

HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.

INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -
AFTERNOON

STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.

GRABNER
Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that
neither I nor the unemployment
epartment of the state of Rhose Island
can do anything for you.
(beat)
You've run out of chances. You're
unemployable. Remember last year?
Middle of winter I busted my butt to

GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE-

fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!

LLOYD
Blew it? For your information, we
only missed three days in two months.

HARRY
Yeah, and that was because of a
blizzard

13.

GRABNER
(exploding)
YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!

Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.

HARRY
Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find
something else for us. How about
another crack at that Suicide Hotline?

Grabner jumps up.

GRABNER
OUT!!!!!

INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen
cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.

MENTAL
The briefcase ain't here. He must've
taken it with him.

J.P. SHAY
Shit.
(beat)
Well he's gotta come home sometime.

Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.

MENTAL
Maybe we should leave him a little
message to let 'em know we're playing
hardball.

Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around
the bird, who SCREECHES IN

TERROR.

MENTAL (CONT'D)
(a la Tweety Bird)
I taut I taw a puddy cat.

Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone-
chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.

MENTAL (CONT'D)
(still Tweety)
I did, I did...

DISSOLVE TO:

The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd
and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building
entrance.

LLOYD
Give me what's left of our dough.
I'll go to the corner and buy a few
necessities.

Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night
Train?

HARRY
Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.

CUT TO:

EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
STILL INSIDE.

Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
struggles by using a WALKER.

LLOYD
Excuse me, little old lady, do you
have change for a dollar?

ELDERLY WOMAN
Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...

LLOYD
Well could you do me a favor and
guard this while I go break a dollar?
My wallet's locked in this machine.

15.

ELDERLY LADY
Of course, young man...

Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,
AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he
sees that

SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up
the steps to his apartment.

INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT

The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the
couch, looking almost comatose.

HARRY
Where's the booze?

LLOYD
It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma
Walton. She got my wallet, too.

Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Come on, man, cheer up. We've been
own before. I'm sure we'll land on
our heads somewhere.
HARRY
It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet
Petey he's... he's dead.

Lloyd looks touched by this.

LLOYD
Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What
happened?

HARRY
His head fell off.

LLOYD
His head fell off?

16.

HARRY
Yeah, he was pretty old.

Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.

LLOYD
(hopeful)
I don't suppose he had a warranty...?

HARRY
Nah, I bought him used.

As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.

LLOYD
That's it! I've had it with this
ump! We don't have food, we don't
have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
of larcenous old

LADIES...

HARRY
Okay, calm down.

LLOYD
No I won't calm down.

Lloyd flops down in a chair.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What the hell are we doing here
anyway, Harry? We've got to get out
of this town.
HARRY
Yeah, and go where?

LLOYD
I'll tell you where: someplace warm,
a place where the beer flows like
wine, where beautiful women
instinctively flock like the salmon
of Capistrano.
(dramatic PAUSE)
I'm talking about Aspen.

HARRY
Aspen?

LLOYD
That's right, Aspen.

17.

HARRY
I don't know, Lloyd, the French are
assholes.

LLOYD
Let me ask you something: do you
want to end up like Petey dead in
some flea-ridden apartment, face-
down on a Dear Abby column, with a
soggy sunflower seed pressed against
your beak? Or do you want to enjoy
your life?
(beat)
Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's
eath be in vain. Don't you see what
he was saying? Spread your wings,
man. he was saying? Spread your wings,
man. Fly.

HARRY
(confused)
What are you talking about, Lloyd?
His head fell off.
(dawning realization)
Wait a second, I know what you're up
to. You just wanna go to Aspen so
you can find that girl who lost her
briefcase and you need me to drive
you there.

LLOYD
That's bullshit. I'll drive.
(beat)
And what's so wrong about going
someplace where we know someone who
can plug us into the social pipeline?
HARRY
(torn)
I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should
stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
saving money for the worm store. I'm
getting a little sick and tired of
always running from creditors.

Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry
cityscape.

LLOYD
You know what I'm sick and tired of,
Harry? I'm sick and tired of having
to eek my way through life. I'm sick
and tired of being a nobody.
(MORE)

18.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
(beat)
But most of all, I'm sick and tired
of having nobody.

There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then
Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.

HARRY
Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.

LLOYD
On the other hand, maybe you're right,
Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
try our luck in bankruptcy court.
With all those lawsuits against us,
I'm sure we'll win at least one. It
could be a boost to our egos.

Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches
Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.

HARRY
(emotional)
Petey, I made a promise to you once,
man...
(thinking hard)
...and I'll be damned if I can remember
what it was.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny
Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van
drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER
AERIAL

SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song
continues to play.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat.
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING
on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG:

LLOYD & HARRY
"We've got to get out of this place,
If it's the last thing we ever do,
We've got to get out of this place,
Girl, there's a better life, for me
and you..."

Lloyd turns down the radio.

LLOYD
Well, we're finally doing it. Do you
realize that in all the years we've
known each other, this is the first
time we've done this together.

HARRY
Been run out of town?

LLOYD
Taken a trip.

Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches,
curious.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Why'd you do that?

HARRY
What?

LLOYD
Take your seatbelt off.

HARRY
Because we just cleared the danger
zone.
LLOYD
Huh?

HARRY
Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety
percent of all accidents happen within
five miles of home. We've already
traveled 6.3 miles.

LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:

LLOYD
Well what about the people who live
around here? What if we got into an
accident with one of them?

20.

Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back
on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.

HARRY
Where'd you get those?

LLOYD
Bought 'em when we filled up.

HARRY
Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer
on all expenditures. We're on a tight
budget, remember?

LLOYD
This didn't come out of our travel
fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-
five bucks before we left. You know,
so we could live in style.

HARRY
Where'd you get twenty-five extra
bucks?

LLOYD
I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.

HARRY
You mean the blind kid?

LLOYD
That's right.

Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.

HARRY
What did you sell him, Lloyd?

LLOYD
Just some odds and ends.

HARRY
Specifically?

LLOYD
Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
marbles, Petey, three comic books a
second, are you telling me you sold
my dead bird to a blind kid? Well
who else was I gonna sell it to?

HARRY
But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a
head.

LLOYD
Put your mind at ease, friend. I
took care of it.

At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a
little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing
with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the
ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.

BILLY

MENTAL
Those bastards. They're rubbing it
right in our faces.

J.P. SHAY
Shit! Andre will have a goddamn
aneurysm if we don't get that
briefcase back.
MENTAL
Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And
I'll   tell you something else. They
ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either.
I'll   make sure of that.

Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on
them.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops
more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs.
Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the
air.

BILLY
Come on, boy, fly!

Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS
OUT:

BILLY (CONT'D)
Excuse me, mister. Is there something
wrong with my bird?

Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS
IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.

MENTAL
Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew
south for the winter.

LLOYD
According to this map, about an inch

HARRY
Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map
or we'll never get there. We don't
have enough gas money.
LLOYD
Relax. We have more than enough.

HARRY
I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.

LLOYD
And I believe I'm right, Harry.

HARRY
I still say wrong, Lloyd.

LLOYD
How much you wanna bet?

HARRY
I don't bet.

Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.

LLOYD
What do you mean you don't bet?

HARRY
I mean I don't gamble, you know that.
Never have and never will.

LLOYD
Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal
that I can get you gambling before
the day's out.

HARRY
There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do
it.

LLOYD
I'll give you three-to-one odds.
That's three feedbags if you win,
against only one if you lose.

HARRY
You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I
already told you, I don't gamble.

LLOYD
Okay, five-to-one I can get you
gambling before the day's out.

HARRY
Sorry, pal, no way.

LLOYD
Make it ten-to-one.
Harry sticks out his hand.

You got yourself a bet, sucker!

As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE.
Harry immediately realizes he's been had.

INT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables
of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle-
aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a
couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of
the boys and starts to walk away.

LLOYD
(to Waitress)

UH, EXCUSE ME...

The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What's the soup du jour?

WAITRESS
It's the soup-of-the-day.

LLOYD
Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.

WAITRESS
(sarcastic)
Anything else before I leave the
area?

HARRY
Actually, this chocolate milk isn't
mixed very well. Could you please
bring me a spoon?

The Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS
INTO THE STRAW, MIXING
THE DRINK.

WAITRESS
There. Now you don't need one.

The guys watch her stomp away.

LLOYD

FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID-

back country-folk, don't it, Harry?

Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put
it in the ashtray, he accidentally

KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.

25.

LLOYD
Uh-oh...

HARRY
What's the matter?

LLOYD
You spilled the salt. That's bad
luck. We're driving across the country
and the last thing we need is bad
luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt
over your right shoulder.

HARRY
What for?

LLOYD
Because that's good luck.

Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it
over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a

YELP.

MALE VOICE
(o.s.)
What the fuck?!

LLOYD
Or was it the left shoulder?

They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his
eyes.

TRUCKER
Who's the dead man threw shit in my
eye?

The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's
wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM,
SIXTY-NINE 'EM.

HARRY
It was a terrible accident, Sir.
Believe me, I would never do anything
to offend a man of your size. Please
accept my most sincere apology.

The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his
equally burly FRIENDS.

BURLY FRIEND #1
Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!

Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.

SEA BASS
You gonna eat that?

HARRY
Um... the thought had crossed my mind.

At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF
TOBACCO SPIT ONTO

THE HAMBURGER.

SEA BASS
Still want it?

Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.

HARRY
Nah, you go ahead.

Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to

Well if you'd stop picking fights
with the locals...

Wait a second. I think I just had an

Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A
nervous Harry trails after him.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like
to apologize for that unpleasant
scene a little earlier.

SEA BASS
Huh?

LLOYD
What I'm trying to say is, my friend
and I would like to buy you guys a
round of beers, just to bury the
hatchet.

Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the
Truckers seem to like the idea.

SEA BASS
Make it four boiler-makers.

LLOYD
Whatever you want, sir. I'll have
the waitress send them over. Oh, and
fellas hope to see you again down
the road.

Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.

HARRY
Lloyd, what are you doing? You know
we can't afford to buy them drinks.

Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.

LLOYD
Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered
to pick up our check. They said just
add this to their tab.

CASHIER
(skeptical)
Sea Bass said that?

LLOYD
Well, if that guy at the table over
there is Sea Bass...

He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass
NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING
TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.

CASHIER
Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...

Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy
bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.

Oh, and put these on there, too.

Don't worry. That fish-head is

HARRY
I hope so.

Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.

LLOYD
Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a
whiz.

HARRY
Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.
What if they figure out we went the
other way. They'll be on us in no

LLOYD
But I gotta go. What am I supposed
to do?

HARRY
Hold it.

LLOYD
I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.

HARRY
Well... just take a whiz in an empty
beer bottle. There's a couple on the
floor in the back seat.

LLOYD
Are you serious?

HARRY
Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping
now. We could get killed.
Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back
seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND.
Then:

LLOYD
Uh-oh...

What's the matter?

LLOYD
The bottle's almost full and I'm
still going.

HARRY
Well stop going.

I can't stop once I already started,

Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way
in the back seat for an empty.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Jesus, be careful! You almost went
off the road.

HARRY
I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best
I can.

He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the
switch.

They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside
then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:

STATE TROOPER
PULL OVER!

Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
the Trooper.

HARRY

No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
noticing!

He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled
Lloyd.

STATE TROOPER
Then what's that?

He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
between them.

HARRY
Oh, that's nothing, sir.

STATE TROOPER
Do you know it's against the law to
rive with an open alcohol container
in this state?

LLOYD
But, your honor, he's telling the
truth. It's not beer.

The officer smirks.

STATE TROOPER
Is that right?

The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
inspects the beer label, then MOVES

THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.

HARRY
Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
your mouth shut if you knew what was
good for you.

YOU WOULD, TOO...

Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue
and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out
of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary
opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she
slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,
she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
over her shoulder at him.

CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY

Nothing. Nothing at all.

The Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment.
A neon sign blinks: GROUP

DISCOUNTS - HAVE YOUR NEXT AFFAIR HERE.

HARRY
(v.o.)
I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little
sleazy staying here when we're not
even engaged.

LLOYD
(v.o.)
Hey, it's the only motel that charges
by the hour. We can't afford anything
else.

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL

Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI.
Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer
as the water swirls around them.

LLOYD
Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
sheets... You know, there's only one
thing that could make this moment
any better.

35.

HARRY
What's that?

LLOYD
If you had a nice set of knockers.

HARRY
That's two things, Lloyd.

LLOYD
Right now I'd settle for one.

Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and
looks around at the romantic decor.

HARRY
I don't know, Lloyd, these places
just don't do it for me. Brings back
too many memories.

LLOYD
What happened, Harry? Some little
filly break your heart?

HARRY
Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.
We stayed at a place like this once
No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.

LLOYD
Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
for the tractor company?

Harry nods.

HARRY
The same. We had this incredibly
romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd
be together forever.
(SIGHS)
Then about a week later, right out
of the blue, she sends me a John
Deere letter.

LLOYD
That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?

HARRY
I called her up and she gave me some
crap about me not listening to her
enough or something like that. I
wasn't really paying attention.

36.

Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big
gulp.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Thing that really hurts is I think
she was seeing another guy. Never id
find out who.

ON LLOYD - he does his best to hide his GUILT.

CUT TO:

EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL - NIGHT

We see that the black Cadillac is   parked a few cars over
from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P.   Shay in the passenger seat.
PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is   Joe Mental. Outside the
booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently   paces back and forth as he
waits for the phone.

MENTAL
(into phone)
The boys are holed-up in a little
love nest for the night. I think
they're a couple of fucking weirdos.

INT. NICHOLAS ANDRE'S STUDY - NIGHT

NICHOLAS ANDRE is pacing around the room with a cordless
phone. He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses
in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic.

ANDRE
What in hell are those guys up to?
Is it possible that they're Feds?
INTERCUT CONVERSATION

MENTAL
Unlikely from what I've seen.

The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental
to hang up.

ANDRE
I don't like this one goddamn bit,
Mental. You and Shay were supposed
to grab that bag so we could end
this shit. Now I don't know what the
hell's going on.

Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.
The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.

37.

MENTAL
Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...

Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer
to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental
motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental
punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks
the Anxious Man out cold. Then

Mental picks up the phone again.

MENTAL (CONT'D)
Sorry, boss. You were saying...?

ANDRE
Look, Mental, just find out what
they're up to. I want to know who
these guys are.

MENTAL
Don't worry. I'm on it.

Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's
not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.
He's joined by J.P. Shay.

As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW
GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see
a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step
forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental
and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.

SHAY
What the fuck...?

Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he
touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a
siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.

MENTAL
Where's the goddamn dog?

Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now,
forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET

An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her
briefcase) is pacing back and forth in

AN IMPRESSIVE, ANTIQUE-FILLED LIVING ROOM. SEATED ON A COUCH
ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH-

younger second wife, HELEN.

MARY
It just doesn't make any sense. I
left the money exactly where they
instructed me to.

HELEN
Actually, it makes a great deal of
sense, Mary. We should have called
in the authorities the moment we
knew Melvin had been kidnapped.

KARL
Now, Helen, we've been through this
already for Christ's sake, Karl,
these bastards will extort us into
bankruptcy if we let them.

MARY
But I'd never forgive myself if
something happened to Melvin.

KARL
Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen.
She's been through quite enough
already.
MARY
It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all
a little on edge.

Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed
Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.

ANDRE
Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?

KARL
Nothing yet, Nicholas.

Andre looks upset.

ANDRE
Perhaps I should call off the
Preservation benefit this weekend.

39.

IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE-

schedule.

HELEN
No, Nicholas, it's imperative that
we carry on as usual.

The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl
Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.

KARL
Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do
everything they ask. Nothing's going
to happen to Melvin, I promise you.

MARY
Thank you, Daddy.

Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe
Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes
out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his
pocket.

MENTAL
(to Shay)
Lie down on the front seat. After
they pick me up I want you to follow
us.
Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van
to come along.

Harry taps Lloyd back.

HARRY

Lloyd immediately taps Harry.

LLOYD
You're it. Quitsies.

HARRY
(tapping him back)
Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies.
No anti-quitsies. No startsies.

Lloyd shakes his head, defeated.

LLOYD
Damn, you're good, Harry.
(beat)
Hey, didn't I tell you this trip
would be a blast?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van
approaching, and starts WAVING HIS HANDS to flag them down.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Through the windshield we can see Mental waving. The guys
don't slow down, through. The just WAVE BACK as they BLOW
RIGHT BY HIM. Harry also toots the horn, which makes the

SOUND OF A DOG BARKING.

LLOYD
See, I told you these country folks
were friendly, Harry.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road,
Shay sits up in the front seat.

SHAY
What happened?

MENTAL
These fuckers are really pissing me
off now.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

HARRY
Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd:
what exactly do we do when we get to
Aspen?

LLOYD
Well the first thing we do is take a
good deep breath of that famous
Aspenese air.

HARRY
Fresh, huh?

LLOYD
The freshest. They say on any day of
the week you can smell a moose-fart
ten miles away.

HARRY
(sincere)
Wow... talk about paradise.
(beat)
And after we're finished breathing,
what next, Lloyd?

LLOYD
Then we make a splash on the social
scene.

Just then, Lloyd notices something up the road.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Harry, look the golden arches. Pull
over, I'm starving.
CUT TO:

EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAY

The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window.

MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,
and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
two.

Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a
handful of change.

HARRY
Thanks.

42.

Then, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys
absentmindedly DRIVE  OFF. As   they pull out of the parking
lot, the McDonald's  Employee   sticks his head out the window
and WAVES THE BAG OF  FOOD at   them.

MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
Hey!

But the guys are already around the corner.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along.

INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - DAY

HARRY
About this social scene how do you
expect a couple mutts like us to
make a splash in the land of pedigrees
when we don't even have any money?

LLOYD
Look, once we drop the briefcase off
to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll
plug us right into the party circuit.
After that, we do a little of the
ski

SCENE, HOB-NOB WITH THE ELBOW-

rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough
business connections to open a first-class worm operation.
You see, you don't get rich working, Harry. You get rich
knowing the rich.
HARRY
Where'd you hear that?

LLOYD
Some bum down at unemployment.

Harry thinks about this.

HARRY
I don't know, Lloyd.

LLOYD
What's the matter?

HARRY
Money does terrible things to people.
I mean, we could lose our friendship.

43.

Lloyd thinks about this.

LLOYD
Yeah? So?

Harry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS
ON LLOYD.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Hey, wait a second. Hold everything.

HARRY
What?

LLOYD
Aren't you forgetting something?

Harry thinks about this.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Back at Mickey D's? A little matter
you might've overlooked...?

Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail.

HARRY
What?

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

LLOYD
My change.

As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice
something up ahead.
HARRY & LLOYD'S POV - ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, JOE MENTAL IS
WAVING THEM

DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS
THE ROAD,

BLOCKING THEIR PATH.

HARRY
I think this guy's in trouble. Why
on't you pull over.

Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He
pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the
passenger window.

44.

MENTAL
You guys going as far as Des Moines?
My car died and I'm late for a
business meeting.

CUT TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN
THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle
of an argument.

HARRY
It's a fruit.

LLOYD
It's a vegetable.

HARRY
I'm telling you, it's a fruit.

LLOYD
And I happen to know it's a vegetable.

HARRY
Tell you what, why don't we leet an
impartial judge decide.

LLOYD
Fine with me.

Harry turns to Joe Mental.

HARRY
Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:
Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?

Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his
mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF
STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though,
Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of
hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER

The trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is
crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a
pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR
and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER STILL

The Migrant Family is gone now. Harry and Lloyd are playing
a game while Mental stares straight ahead, furious. His eyes
are watering and he looks ill.

LLOYD
Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip.

Harry lifts a cheer and lets out a LOUD FART. Lloyd SNIFFS a
few times, then closes his eyes and WAFTS it up toward his
nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet,
aged to perfection will rip no fart
before it's time.
(beat)
Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's
rules: you got ten seconds. All right.
I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog
extra onions, garden salad with blue...

HARRY
And...?

LLOYD
Kit-Kat bar.

Harry throws up his arms, defeated. He hands Lloyd a buck.

HARRY
You're the best, man.
(beat)
Okay, my turn.
LLOYD
Where are your manners, Harry? We
have a guest.

Harry punches Mental's shoulder playfully.

HARRY
Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly.
It's only a buck.

A large neon road sign beside the café shows a man's
exasperated face with FLAMES SHOOTING FROM HIS NOSE, MOUTH
AND EARS. The sign advertises: HOTTEST CHILI

PEPPERS NORTH OF THE BORDER.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe
Mental. The boys are each holding up a

POINTED RED CHILI PEPPER.

HARRY
I'll do one if you will.

LLOYD
Okay, you go first.

HARRY
No, you go first.

LLOYD
No, you go first.

MENTAL
Why don't you both stop being a couple
of pussies and go at the same time.
It ain't that hot.

Lloyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously BITE
INTO THE PEPPERS.

LLOYD
Hmmm, not bad...

HARRY
Yeah, more tingly than hot.

Suddenly the boys' EYES LIGHT UP. THEY LET OUT A SHRIEK. A
smile begins to curl on Mental's lips. He pours them a couple
glasses of water from a pitcher.

MENTAL
Have some water. It'll help.

Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start
to GULP down their water. This, of course, makes it burn
more.

MENTAL (CONT'D)
Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just
makes it worse...

The boys run to the bar and DUMP PITCHERS OF WATER ON THEIR
HEADS, much to the elight of a CHUCKLING Joe Mental.

CUT TO:

47.

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY

Mental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to
Nicholas Andre.

INTERCUT CONVERSATION

MENTAL
It's Mental. I'm just sitting down
to a nice meal with our boys.

ANDRE
Good work. What did you find out so
far?

MENTAL
Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em
own for information at lunch.
(beat)
Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.

ANDRE
Well eat fast, time's running out.

And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. I don't
need them here running around Aspen.

Mental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket.

MENTAL
Relax, they ain't gonna be running
around anywhere after I dump a little
cyanide in their pops.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY
Back at the table, the boys are soaked and HUFFING as if
they just finished the Boston Marathon. The burgers have
been served, but Lloyd and Harry are still too traumatized
to touch them.

HARRY
That really wasn't very polite of
him, was it? Maybe we should loosen
the screws of his chair.

LLOYD
Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you.
Perhaps it's about time you brushed

UP ON A LITTLE TOME THAT WE GOD-

fearing adults call the Bible. It's crammed with all kinds
of pithy rules to live your life by.

48.

HARRY
(humbled)
You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'

LLOYD
No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.'
Hand me those peppers the atomic
ones.

Harry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S
BURGER WITH CHILI

PEPPERS, EXPERTLY CAMOUFLAGING THEM WITH LETTUCE.

HARRY
(whispering)
Here he comes.

Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back
down at the table.

MENTAL
Feeling any better, boys?

As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each
other and TITTER. Then he picks it up and brings it to his
mouth. Just before biting into it, though, he PAUSES.

MENTAL (CONT'D)
So tell me, why you fellas headed to
Aspen? Vacation?

LLOYD
More like re-location.

Mental starts toward the burger but stops again.
MENTAL
Doesn't look like you packed much.
All I saw was a couple bags... and
that briefcase.

HARRY
The briefcase isn't even ours. Some
lady just left it at the airport.
We're bringing it back to her.

This is news to Mental.

MENTAL
You mean you don't even know her?

LLOYD
Not really. I was just her limo river.

49.

Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're
serious. Then he BREAKS OUT

LAUGHING.

MENTAL
Talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time...

Lloyd and Harry share a     confused look. Mental shakes his
head and BITES INTO HIS     BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost
immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF
HORROR. His FACE TURNS     RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS
TO THE

GROUND, GASPING.

The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help
him.

HARRY
Hey, you okay, man? It was just a
goof.

MENTAL
(STRAINED WHISPER)
My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...

Harry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but
unwittingly brings out the BLACK        OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes
some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in
his mouth and starts to MUNCH on        them.

For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and
he sits up. Then his EYES
LIGHT UP.

MENTAL'S POV - QUICK ZOOM IN on the black bottle Harry is
holding!

You son-of-a-bitch!

Mental GURGLES and keels over, DEAD.

the next minute you're dead meat.

HARRY
But he blamed me. You heard him.
Those were his last words.

LLOYD
If you don't count that gurgling
sound.

Harry lets out a GROAN.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Hey, relax, man, I'm just as
responsible as you are we both
slipped him the peppers and look at
me, I on't feel guilty at all.

HARRY
Small comfort coming from a man who
sells dead birds to blind kids.
(SIGHS)
Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a
ead guy pissed at me. His restless
spirit will probably haunt me for
the next seventy-five years.

That's ridiculous. You probably won't
live to see forty.

Harry perks up, cheered by this thought.

Oh yeah.

DOCTOR
...My official conclusion is that the

caused by the presence of cyanide in
the bloodstream.

DT. DALE
You mean he was poisoned?

DOCTOR
Unquestionably. We found these by
the body.

He holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods
and approaches another COP in the b.g.

COP
Waitress says he was with a couple

who called the ambulance then they
hit the road.

DT. DALE
Any idea where they were going?

COP
A witness at the next table thought
he heard them say they were driving

Dale frowns at this and the Cop shrugs.

LLOYD
Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold

HARRY
What happened to the dough?

LLOYD
We over-leveraged.

HARRY

LLOYD
I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives
on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd
Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers
at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we
see a series of quick shots:

A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep
with his feet now on Harry's lap.

Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight
ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window
and his head is on Harry's lap.

The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are
now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet
should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD,
GAS NEXT EXIT.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background
are several tractor-trailer rigs and a café. Harry climbs
out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the
passenger door.

Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him
with his foot.

HARRY
Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.

Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT
ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he
sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.

55.

EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Lloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY
ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.
When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine
on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
out. This seems to wake Harry up.

The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to
brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
to the skis on her   roof-rack.

HARRY
Skis, huh?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
That's right.

HARRY
Great.

She continues to pump gas.

HARRY (CONT'D)
They yours?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Uh-huh..

HARRY
Both of 'em?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Um, yeah.

HARRY
(impressed)
Cool.

THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T
NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS

like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.

56.

Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He
immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
as she smiles to herself.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read
the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one
that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993,
2:15

A.M. SHARP.

He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.

CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8.

ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15.

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the
BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd
quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet
bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see
a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely
hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds
his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a
SIGH OF RELIEF.

All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE
STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.

HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.

SEA BASS
Well, well, well, if it ain't my old
friend.
(checks watch)
And right on time...

As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we

CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-
view mirror.

57.

HARRY
(re: suitcases in
back seat)
That's a lot of luggage for a little
vacation.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've
got to get away from my boyfriend.

He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid
accident-prone guys.

Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS

HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN
QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

HARRY
(holding out mirror)
Here, this is a little loose.

She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Allow me...

He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match
to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)

HARRY (CONT'D)
Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
we can meet up... you know, for hot
chocolate or something.

She looks him over and smiles.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
I'll give you my number. Just let me
find a pen.

As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE
SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still
searching for a pen.

58.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
I know I have one here somewhere...

Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
This only helps to fan them.

HARRY
(urgently)
Look, why don't you just tell it to
me, I've got a good memory.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Are you sure you won't forget?

HARRY
(desperate)
Positive please hurry.

He begins hopping around violently.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Is something wrong?

Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
Okay, my number is 652-2553.
(beat)
Oh, wait a second, that's my old
number. It's so funny how your mind
god sakes, give me the damn number!

She's taken aback by this outburst.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
you can just forget it!

She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he
slides him up the wall of the toilet stall.

SEA BASS
First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm
gonna kill you. Any last request?

LLOYD
Um, yeah could you do it the other
way around?

59.

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps
back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a
green color to Lloyd's face.

ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED
Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his
desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA
BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the
toilet,

EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.

Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice
LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND

SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE.

Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he
lets out an admonishing

WHISTLE.

HARRY
You've got some serious explaining
to o, young man.

CUT TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

CLOSE UP - of Harry's BURNT SHOE     with the toes sticking out
on the accelerator.

LLOYD
Look, Harry, I told you what happened,
now drop it.
HARRY
Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to
mention another word about you being
in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,
five-inch trucker with his pants
own.

LLOYD
That's a low blow, man.

HARRY
Not at that height it's not.

LLOYD
Listen, bud, if you're trying to
imply that I'm that thought look,
we're almost in Colorado.

60.

LLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS:
LAST EXIT IN NEBRASKA -

COLORADO STATE LINE - 3 MILES.

HARRY
I think it's about   time we pull over
and change seats.   I've been driving
for nine straight   hours I  don't
have the energy to   start a new state.

Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A SIGN - it reads WELCOME  TO COLORADO, HOME OF THE
ROCKY MOUNTAINS. PAN DOWN to reveal  a number of POLICEMEN
stopping and checking cars as they  cross the border. A
HELICOPTER lands on the side of the  road and Detective Dale
hops out. He hurries to the COP in  charge.

DT. DALE
Any sign of them yet?

COP
No, but we're expecting them shortly.
A motorist said he spotted a pooch
about thirty miles back headed this
way.

Detective Dale nods, satisfied.

CUT TO:

EXT. MINI MART - NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT of a mini mart.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

The door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos
and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a
Beef Jerky out of his back pocket.

LLOYD
Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky...

When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already
fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Boy, some guys just weren't cut out
for life on the road.

61.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to
the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we
ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly
headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING

It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in
the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a
bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open.

LLOYD
Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.

HARRY
(groggy)
How long have I been out?

LLOYD
I'd say a good five hours, anyway.

Harry yawns and stretches.

HARRY
Great. We must be getting real close,
huh?

LLOYD
Should be. I've been averaging about
ninety miles an hour all night.

HARRY
Good man.

LLOYD
Boy, I'll tell you, this is one
angerous highway. You wouldn't believe
all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
couple of rabbits, a snake and some
big thing I couldn't even recognize.

HARRY
That's awful. Did you see them get
hit or were they already lying there?

LLOYD
I hit 'em.

Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS.

62.

HARRY
Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains
to be a little rockier than this.

LLOYD
I was thinking the same thing. That
John Denver's some full of shit,
huh?

They both stare out the window.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
I must say, Des Moines sure is a
pretty little town.

HARRY
Yeah, it really is.
(beat)
Wait a minute when did you visit
Des Moines?

LLOYD
Last night. We drove through it.

HARRY
What are you talking about? You were
snoring like a baby when we went
through Des Moines.

Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS
in Harry's face.

LLOYD
(sing-song)
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and
shine.
(LAUGHS)
You were the one who was asleep,

numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious.

A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing
terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.

HARRY
Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't
the sun rise in the east and set in
the west?

LLOYD
In our country it does, yes.

63.

HARRY
Then perchance you can explain to me
why the sun is in our face at 7:30
in the morning when we're heading
west.

Lloyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRUCKSTOP - MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry
is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.

LLOYD
I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can
make a mistake.

But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Come on, man, pull yourself together.

HARRY
You know, I got half a mind to just
jump on the bus to Europe and say
goodbye to your ugly mug forever.

LLOYD
(rolls his eyes)
You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.

HARRY
Oh yeah? Why not?
LLOYD
You don't have a passport.

Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Come on, stop being a baby about
this. Okay, so we back-tracked a
tad.

HARRY
A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
sixth of the way across the country
in the wrong direction. Now we don't
have enough money to get to Aspen,
we on't have enough money to get
home, we don't have enough to eat,
we don't have enough to sleep!

64.

LLOYD
Well it doesn't do any good having
you sitting there on your butt whining
about it. If we're gonna get out of
this hole, we're gonna have to dig
ourselves out.

Harry thinks about this.

HARRY
You know, you're absolutely right,
Lloyd.

He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
the highway.

LLOYD
Where you going?

HARRY
Home. I'm walking home.

LLOYD
You can't be serious.

HARRY
(sarcastic)
Why not? We're probably only five
miles away.

Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.

LLOYD
(CALLING OUT)
Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
never screwed up.
Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his
friend. He seems completely rained.

HARRY
Look, man... I'm sorry.
(beat)
I never should have let you talk me
into this in the first place. You've
got a good reason to goo a beautiful
girl's waiting for you. But let's
face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
waiting for me in Aspen.
(beat)
There's nothing waiting for me
anywhere.

65.

Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks
away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,
causing it to BARK.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping
at his clothes.

A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG  OF GARBAGE out the
window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME  CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S
FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian
in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of  garbage. We see
it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.

Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking
vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls
down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.

LLOYD
Got room for one more, if you still
want to go to Aspen.

Harry looks the hearse over.

HARRY
Where'd you find this baby?

LLOYD
Used car dealer. I   traded the van
for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw
in fifty bucks for   gas money.
(beat)
Come on, man, what   do you say? We
still partners?

HARRY SMILES AND WE

CUT TO:

EXT. COLORADO STATE LINE - DAY

An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the
Colorado border with several other officers.

DT. DALE
It doesn't make sense. They should've
been here hours ago.

COP
Maybe they're smarter than we thought.

66.

DT. DALE
How smart can they be? They're riving
a goddamn dog!

Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie.

COP #2
We just got a report that they were
spotted about two hours ago heading
east near Des Moines on I-80.

DT. DALE
(incredulous)
Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred
miles from here!

COP #1
Guess they got wind of our welcoming
party.

DT. DALE
We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.

Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow.
As the officers climb into their cars, we

CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window.

LLOYD
Tell me something, Harry. Would you
really have kept going home if I
hadn't come back to get you?

HARRY
Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:
Do you remember when we were Cub
Scouts and we got lost in the woods
uring that blizzard? We huddled
together all night, and we made an
oath that if we ever got out of there
alive we'd never ever leave each
other's side again. Do you remember
that?

Lloyd thinks hard about this.

LLOYD
We were never Cub Scouts.

67.

HARRY
Exactly.

Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite
direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry
glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN
in the rear of the vehicle.

HARRY (CONT'D)
What the hell is this? There's a
coffin in the back!

LLOYD
Relax, it's empty.

HARRY
I don't give a shit. I'm not driving
anywhere with a casket. You know I'm
superstitious calm down. We'll dump
it off first chance we get.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse.
Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is
a CADILLAC.

INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY

(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and
a WOMAN are arguing.

WOMAN
I married a cheapskate.

MAN
Shut your trap, Gerdie.

WOMAN
I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be
able to show my face again.

MAN
I knew something good would come out
of this.

WOMAN
We could have given him a more
ignified burial.

68.

MAN
Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember
what he got us for our twenty-fifth?
A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm
gonna spend a load to get him planted.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of
them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the
ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY

FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE.

CUT TO:

EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY

Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the
market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys
get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back.
Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER
AND WIPE THEIR HANDS

OFF.

ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is
practically on the floor.

WOMAN
You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!

CUT TO:

QUICK MONTAGE OF THE HEARSE WEAVING IT'S WAY THROUGH THE
SCENIC ROCKIES AS WE REPRISE 'MARY'S PRAYER' BY DANNY WILSON.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The hearse drives past a sign that says ENTERING ASPEN,
COLORADO.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - DAY

The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows,
studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of
the ski town.

69.

LLOYD
Isn't this wonderful? What more could
a couple of single guys like us ask
for?

HARRY
How about food and shelter?

LLOYD
You're so materialistic.
(beat)
Why don't we get down to business
and eliver the briefcase to Mary.
Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
for tea and a strumpet or two?

HARRY
Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes
the lovely young lady reside?

LLOYD
Um... good question.

Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone
booth next to them.

HARRY
Well what's her last name? We'll
look it up in the phone book.

LLOYD
Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I
caught that either.

Harry's concern grows.
HARRY
What about the briefcase, Lloyd?
There must've been a name on it,
right?

LLOYD
(brightening)
Come to think of it, there is. It's
engraved right into the leather.

HARRY
What is it?

LLOYD
Samsonite   spelled just like it
sounds.

70.

Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly
HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.

CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a
picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the
front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse.
They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and
sipping it.

HARRY
Any soup left?

LLOYD
A little. Shall we share it?

HARRY
Please.

Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it
into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a
few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.

LLOYD
Mmmm mmmm good...

Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and
leans toward him.

HARRY
Hey, you got something stuck in your
front teeth.
Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.

LLOYD
Hmmm... looks like an old piece of
Beef Jerky.

HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:

HARRY
Wanna split it?

LLOYD
You're pathetic. Get your own.

Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.
Another gust of wind swirls around them.

71.

HARRY
I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.

LLOYD
Roll up your window.

HARRY
It is rolled up.

LLOYD
Then I guess the damn anti-cold system
isn't working. You really should get
it fixed if we're gonna live here
all winter.

HARRY
What anti-cold system?

Lloyd points to the dash.

LLOYD
Right here the A/C button. I put it
on full blast about an hour ago and,
if anything, the car's getting colder.

Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.
He opens the car door and starts to climb out.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What are you going out there for?

HARRY
To warm up.

EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT
Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.

LLOYD
What are you worrying about now?

HARRY
I'm worried about how you're gonna
survive the pummeling I'm about to
give you.

LLOYD
Huh?

Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the
other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd
manages to evade his grasp.

72.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Harry, calm down! You're acting like
a wild animal!

HARRY
Get over here and take your medicine,
Lloyd!

LLOYD
Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
I'm a Christian Scientist!

Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated,
Harry opens the car and PULLS THE

BRIEFCASE OUT.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

HARRY
Something I should've done a long
time ago. This stupid thing has been
the root of our problems all along.

Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.

LLOYD
Don't do anything foolish, Harry.

HARRY
Foolish? This is the most sensible
thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
toss this goddamn curse right into
that river.
Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.

LLOYD
You're making a big mistake, Harry!
I'll never forgive you for this!

Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
of the briefcase.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
better, I promise! In fact, I think

I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's
yours, Harry, all yours!

Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.

73.

HARRY
You're bluffing.

LLOYD
No I'm not, man look.

Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints
at it.

HARRY
That's a filling, you liar!

Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,
but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase
GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow, rolling over and over.

Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on
top and CLASPS HIS HANDS

AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.

HARRY (CONT'D)
I used to have a life! A miserable
one, but a life, nonetheless!

Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.
behind his friend.

LLOYD
(CHOKED VOICE)
Harry, look!

Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd
as we see
THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND,
REVEALING STACKS AND

STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS!

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - NIGHT

Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching
the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny
lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.

LLOYD
Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a
few bucks just a small loan from
the briefcase, and we check into a
cheap motel.

74.

HARRY
Sounds good.

LLOYD
And we'll keep track of the money we
spend with IOUs.

HARRY
We'll be meticulous    right down to
the last penny.

LLOYD
That way, whatever we borrow we can
pay back.

HARRY
Absolutely. We're good for it.

LLOYD
You know, as soon as we get jobs.

HARRY
It'll come right out of our first
paycheck.

CUT TO:

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around
an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to
throw a touchdown bomb in.

BARNARD
...This is the Hotel Danbury's
Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's
normally reserved for royalty,
visiting dignitaries, and illustrious
stars of stage and take it.

The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.

BARNARD (CONT'D)
Very good, sir. Are there any bags
you'd like sent up?

LLOYD
Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our
own chicks.

BARNARD
(peevish)
I wasn't talking about ladies.

75.

HARRY
Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up.
What are their names?

Barnard SIGHS.

BARNARD
Sir, I meant your luggage.

Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.

LLOYD
Tell you what you can send up, my
friend how about some chow?

The Bell Captain nods.

BARNARD
I'll bring you a menu.

LLOYD
Don't bother. Just order us one of
everything.

At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.

HARRY
One of everything? Lloyd...

Lloyd looks guilty.

LLOYD
Oh, sorry.
(beat)
Make that two of everything.
Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in
Barnard's top pocket.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
And here you go, Barney. You keep us
happy, we'll keep you happy.

The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.

BARNARD
Yes, sir!

He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the
briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE

OF PAPER.

76.

LLOYD
(proudly)
Our first IOU. Signed and dated.

CUT TO:

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

Helen Swanson is KNOCKING on her step-daughter's bedroom
door. She's holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it.

HELEN
Mary? You awake?

MARY
(o.s.)

COME IN...

INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French
windows when Helen ENTERS.

HELEN
I brought you some tea. I thought it
might help you relax.

Mary smiles.

MARY
Thank you.

She takes a mug, sips, and pulls back.

MARY (CONT'D)
Yech! What's in this, whiskey?

HELEN
Uh, sorry... that one's mine.

Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one.

HELEN (CONT'D)
Feeling any better, honey?

Mary can't take her eyes from the window.

MARY
Just knowing that Melvin's out there,
being held by God knows who...
(fighting back tears)
It's all my fault. I should've been
there.

77.

HELEN
Bullshit. You can't blame yourself
for this. If you'd been there they
would've taken you, too.

Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.

MARY
Maybe we should just pay them the
money again and get this thing over

with.

HELEN
Now Mary, everything that can be
done is being done. You've got to
stop torturing yourself.

MARY
What am I supposed to do? Go about
my life as if everything were fine?

HELEN
That's exactly what you should do.
Get the hell out more, go skiing,
socialize. Don't you see, honey? We
can't let on that anything is wrong.
If the press or authorities get wind
of this, the kidnappers might panic.
(beat)
Who knows what they'd do to poor
Melvin then?

AS MARY THINKS ABOUT THIS, WE

CUT TO:
EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse.
Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd
get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur
boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors
everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and
then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.
Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the
balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the
mountain view.

78.

HARRY
Oh god, it's really true. Last night
I thought I might've been dreaming.

LLOYD
It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked
the big time.

HARRY
And it was so simple. All it took
was somebody else's money.

Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty
puff, and

EXHALES.

HARRY (CONT'D)
You know, Lloyd, I think you might've
gone a little overboard with the
spending today.

He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.

LLOYD
What's the big deal? We're gonna pay
it all back anyway, right?

HARRY
Sure, but do you really think you
needed to buy those two surfboards?

LLOYD
Surfboards? I thought those were
beginner's skis.
This suddenly makes sense to Harry.

HARRY
Ahhh. I was wondering why you had
those bindings put on them.

Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.

LLOYD
Where'd this come from?

HARRY
(sheepishly)
I bought it.

LLOYD
What for?

79.

HARRY
I like the feel of it against my
skin...
(defensive)
...I mean, you know, when a woman's
wearing it.

Lloyd inspects it more closely.

LLOYD
Harry, how many women do you know
who wear a size XXL?

HARRY
Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.
I'm supposed to have a few
eccentricities.

There's a KNOCK on the door.

LLOYD
Enter, parlez vous!

The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket
and a newspaper under his arm.

BARNARD
I brought you your newspaper and
some champagne, gentlemen.
Unfortunately, we didn't seem to
have the, um, label you requested.

Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.

LLOYD
All out of Boone's Farm, huh?
BARNARD
You have a rapier wit, sir. I took
the liberty of bringing a comparable
substitute: Dom Perignon.

LLOYD
Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?

Lloyd smiles and over tips him.

BARNARD
Thank you so much, sir.

He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads
for the door.

80.

LLOYD
Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense
with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,
Barney, we're all from the     same mold.
(winks)
We just have a little more     dough
than you right now.

Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He
picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,
sending out a resonant RING.

HARRY
Cocktail hour has commenced!

He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins
thumbing through the newspaper.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Hey, later on what do you say we...?

He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something
he's found in the paper.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Lloyd... you okay?

LLOYD
(dumbstruck)
Harry, it's her.

HARRY
Who?

LLOYD
Mary with the briefcase. This is
her...

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST
PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath
this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Mary Swanson...

HARRY
Come on, Cinderella, it's time to
get you ready for the ball...

Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" plays over a...

MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:

81.

-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.

-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The
ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
guys' hair in curlers.

-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.
Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his
fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd
LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in
his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to
the floor to reveal a PILE OF

NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.

-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN
OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard
Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety
goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric
sander.

-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred
dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.

-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with
her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He
couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,
but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman
looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks
sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive
J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND
LLOYD.

DISSOLVE TO:

82.

EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT

Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dollars.

LLOYD
Thanks for the lift, Barney.

INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY

Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when
Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
the once over.

ANDRE
Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd
takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels

off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.

LLOYD
This should cover a couple plates.

HARRY
I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
we want seconds?

Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
LLOYD
Put us down for four plates, my good
man.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate
J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

J.P. SHAY
(WHISPERING)
Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.

BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through
the affluent crowd.

LLOYD
I'm getting nervous, Harry.

83.

HARRY
relax, Lloyd. These people are just
like you and me.

LLOYD
What are you talking about? They're
educated, well-bred, charming, and
sophisticated.

HARRY
So what? We can be sophistica holy
shit, would you look at the fun bags
on that hose hound.

He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.
Lloyd rolls his eyes.

LLOYD
Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm
already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
like me?

HARRY
Look, let's just go saddle up to the
bar and down a couple bowls of
loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
over-confidence.

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
make their way to the bar.

LLOYD
(to BARTENDER)
Two martinis, straight up.
As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL
RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
walks away.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Shut up, Harry.

HARRY
I didn't say anything.

LLOYD
Yeah, well I know what you were gonna
say and I'm telling you to shut up
in advance.

HARRY
How do you know what I was gonna
say?

84.

LLOYD
I read you like a book.

HARRY
Okay, if you read me like a book
then what was I gonna say?

LLOYD
You were gonna say:
(in Harry's looped
VOICE)
'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
mind roasting my weenie in.'

Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
And I would say 'shut up', because
this is our chance to get in with
the rich and powerful and you don't
ingratiate yourself to the kind of
people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
Spanish Fly.

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a
LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and
Elizabeth Swanson.

ANDRE
If I could have your attention,
please...

The crowd QUIETS.
ANDRE (CONT'D)
I'd like to thank you all for coming
to this very special event. As you

KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -

founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl
and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
endangered species. Our

SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-

three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,
we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth.

85.

The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the
podium.

MR. SWANSON
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
Icelandic Snow Owl.

He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE
OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.

MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
These magnificent specimens were

RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-

year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they
constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks
pale.

MR. SWANSON
Here these lovely birds will be
allowed to breed in a natural but
protected habitat. And, God willing,
with your help and that of the
Society's, we will see these wonderful
creatures flourish once more.

More APPLAUSE.

MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
Again, thank you, and enjoy your
evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
closer look at our new friends here.
Enjoy.

The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns
back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.

LLOYD
Two more, please.

Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.

HARRY
Lloyd, I've never seen you this
uptight. You've gotta chill out.

LLOYD
I can't help it. This is a very
important night for me.
(MORE)

86.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
(beat)
Harry, have you ever wondered why
you and I never have long-term
girlfriends?

HARRY
What are you talking about? I went
out with Fraida Felcher for two and
a half weeks.

LLOYD
That was a fluke.
(beat)
The reason we never have long-term
girlfriends is because of one thing:
We're afraid of the C word.

HARRY
That's crazy. We live for the C word.

LLOYD
I'm talking bout commitment.

HARRY
(beat)
Oh.

LLOYD
Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
The first time I laid eyes on Mary
Swanson, I knew she was the one.
(beat)
Some things you feel in your heart,
other things you feel in your groin.
This girl makes me feel it all in
the heart.

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.

HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE
OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A

spectacular black cocktail dress.

Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Oh shit, there she is.

87.

HARRY
(checking her out)
Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
She's an angel.
(beat)
Well, what are you waiting for? Get
over there and talk to her.

LLOYD
She's gonna think I'm some kind of
psycho when she realizes how far I
came just to see her.

HARRY
You have her briefcase she's gonna
be thrilled to see you.

LLOYD
And then what? She'll take it back
and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.

Harry thinks about this a moment.

HARRY
Look, man, you just drove two thousand
miles to see this girl. Don't quit
on the last fifty feet.

LLOYD
(brightening)
Wait a second, I have an idea. You
go over and introduce yourself. That
way you can build me up so when I
come along I won't have to brag about
myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
wit.

HARRY
I can't tell her you're good looking,
Lloyd she's got eyes.

Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.

LLOYD
Please Harry, I'm appealing to you
as one loser to another. Just build
me up and then give me a signal to
come over. Please.

Harry SIGHS.

88.

HARRY
All right. But you're gonna owe me a
big one for this.

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES
Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Nice set of hooters you got there.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.

MARY
I beg your pardon?

HARRY
The owls. They're beautiful.

MARY
Oh. Yeah.
(beat)
Are you a bird lover?

HARRY
Well, I used to have a parakeet, but
my main area of expertise is canines
that's dogs to the layperson.

She smiles at this.

MARY
Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how

are you involved with them?

HARRY
Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them; I've even bred them.

MARY
Really? Any unusual breeding?

HARRY
Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But
one time we successfully mated a
Bulldog and a Shitzu.

MARY
Really? That's weird.

HARRY
Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
(breaks out LAUGHING)
Just a little breeder joke.

89.

She seems strangely charmed by this.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Anyway, the real reason I came over
is because I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed.

HELEN
Mary, I don't believe I've met your
friend.

MARY
Actually, we haven't been introduced
yet.
(holds out hand)
I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
stepmother, Helen.

HARRY
Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
both.

HELEN
I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
I was hoping we'd get a chance to
meet.

HARRY
(taken aback)
You were?

HELEN
That tuxedo I love a man with a
sense of humor. So does Mary.

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.

HARRY
Really?

For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages
to snap out of it.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Anyway, about my friend you doing
anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
I believe Mary's looking for somebody
to hit the slopes with. Whuh?

MARY
Helen, you're embarrassing me.

90.

HELEN
Well you are, aren't you?
(to Harry)
Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So
what do you say, Harry? Are you
available?

Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
hopeful Lloyd.

HARRY
Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend
your friends for one day. You and
Mary will have a ball.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
thing is... sure.

ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.

LLOYD
How come you didn't call me over?

HARRY
Relax, you're golden. I got you a
ate with her tomorrow.

Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's
SPEECHLESS.

LLOYD
Wha... you... I... it's...
(smiles)
I love you, man. I love you!

Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.

HARRY
Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making
a scene.

Lloyd steps back elated.

LLOYD
This calls for a toast!

He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to
open it.

91.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
You're gonna be my best man, Har, I
mean it. It was always between you
and my future wife's brother, but
you just earned a seat at the head
table, pal.

Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND
ZIPS ACROSS

THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN
WIDER-

EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!,
and a THUMP!

A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their
stunned attention to the cage.

THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE
CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW

Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to
extinction.

Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking
champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.

HARRY
(under breath)
I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
Lloyd.

The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before
anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for
Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been
standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't
look very happy.

CUT TO:

INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand
while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.

J.P. SHAY
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

ANDRE
Don't be stupid. It's a message,
plain and simple: We killed their
bird, now they killed ours.

92.

J.P. SHAY
But how could anybody off a bird
with a cork?

ANDRE
These guys arent' just anybody.
They're good. Look what they did to
Mental. He was the best, and yet he
fell right into their web.

J.P. SHAY
But the bastards already got our
money. What the hell more could they
want?

Andre runs his fingers through his hair.

ANDRE
(at wit's end)
I don't know, god damn it!

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING

A jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. In the
b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a
pair of thermal tights.

LLOYD
Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.
Mary Christmas. You

know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har?

HARRY
Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you
think you may be jumping the gun a
little? I mean, who knows, when you
get to know her, you may find out
she's not your type.

LLOYD
Impossible. I know my type    when I
see it. Now let me get this    straight,
she wants me to meet her at    the
Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main
Street?

HARRY
That's what she said. Ten o'clock
sharp.

This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.

93.

LLOYD
Time out. Where are going ressed
like that.

HARRY
I, uh, thought while you were making
your love connection I'd try my luck
on the slopes.

LLOYD
You mean you're gonna go out in public
dressed in tights?

HARRY
These aren't tights. They're
fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.

LLOYD
But you can see the outline of your
who-who.

Harry looks down at his crotch.

HARRY
Really?

LLOYD
Turn sideways.

Harry turns his profile against the window.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Actually, it's just a tiny little
lump. No one will ever notice.

HARRY
You're right. I can't go out dressed
like this.

CUT TO:

EXT. ASPEN BASE LODGE - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.

INT. ASPEN BASE LODGE

People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined
up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace
in an incredibly sexy snowsuit.

94.

Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As
he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward
Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over
a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he
reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.

HARRY
Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving
a clutch with these things.

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple
ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into
position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.
The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a
smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is
STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.
Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be
stretching.

HARRY
(CALLING OUT)
You take the first run alone. I'm
gonna loosen up down here.

CUT TO:

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - DAY

Lloyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the
day.

WAITER
I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven.
This is disconcerting news to Lloyd.

LLOYD
I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait
at the bar?

The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it
rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.
Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.

MARY
Beautiful day, huh, Harry?

95.

HARRY
Glorious.

Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.

MARY
God, it feels so good to get up here.
I haven't been outdoors much in the
last couple of weeks.

HARRY
Why not?

MARY
(evasive)
There's been... family problems. I
on't want to bore you with them.

HARRY
Thanks.

He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices
a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Oh, look... frost.

He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN
METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.

MARY
Are you okay?

HARRY
(lisping)
Sure. I do this all the time...
CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary
disembarks but Harry stays on.

HARRY
(lisping)
See ya at the bottom...

Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down
the hill.

CUT TO:

96.

EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAY

The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on
it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him.

HARRY
(lisping)
Hi.
(off their looks)
Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to
have a cup of warm water, would you?

The two kids just stare at him.

CUT TO:

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON

A despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him
now. The bar   is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled
about. Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the
clock on the   wall. It's 12:30.

We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to
him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that
Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Hi.

Lloyd GRUNTS a hello.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
Bad day, huh?

Lloyd GRUNTS once more.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
(big smile)
well don't worry, Mercury's supposed
to be coming out or retrograde
tonight. Things will get better.

AS LLOYD GRUNTS AGAIN, WE

CUT TO:

EXT. BASE LODGE - AFTERNOON

Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and
stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the
outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE-
TAKE.

97.

MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO
THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH

has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of
coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of
the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g.

BACK TO SCENE

MARY
My god. Harry, are you okay?

HARRY
(lisping)
I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP of Harry's head through a RIFLE SCOPE. REVERSE ANGLE
to reveal J.P. Shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a
high-powered rifle trained on Harry.

SHAY
You're luck just ran out, pal.

As his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go

BACK TO SCENE

MARY
This is silly. Let me help you...

Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously.
She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away
from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY...
FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly,
his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards
out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We
hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain:

MIME
GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!

The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously
into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him.

CUT TO:

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON

Lloyd's now swimming in despair, as the Athletic Beauty
RAMBLES ON beside him.

98.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
...Anyway, after my boyfriend backed
into my garage for the third time, I
said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for
your life before he kills you both'.
Then you know what the klutz does
and to be perfectly honest, I on't
really care.
(beat)
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very
good company today. I'll say.
(beat)
I have an idea. Why don't you tell
me a little about yourself.

LLOYD
Maybe some other time.

Lloyd motions for the BARTENDER.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to
know a Mary Swanson, would you?

BARTENDER
Sure. Her family comes in here all
the time.

LLOYD
Do you know where she lives?

BARTENDER
Yeah, they got that big place up on
Alpine Drive.

CUT TO:
EXT. SWANSON CHALET - LATE AFTERNOON

The hearse pulls up to the house and stops.

INT. HEARSE

MARY
I've got to tell you, today was really
just what I needed. Thanks a lot,
Harry.

HARRY
My pleasure, Mary.

She beams and gives him a KISS on the cheek.

99.

MARY
So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?

HARRY
Better make it quarter to eight.
I've got a few things to take care
of first.

Harry watches, lovestruck, as Mary gets out of the car and
walks toward the house.

HARRY (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a
nice ring to it.

We PAN from the hearse to some nearby bushes, where we see a
SHATTERED LLOYD

WATCHING ALL THIS IN DISBELIEF.

LLOYD
Some best man.

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE of Lloyd walking through the hills of Aspen, totally
BUMMED OUT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - EVENING

Lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns
surprise at what he's just heard.
HARRY
It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd.
She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are
you sure you went to the right bar?

LLOYD
Believe me, it was the right place.
(SIGHS)
I don't know, Har, maybe she just
had second thoughts.

HARRY
I have a hard time believing that,
Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't
wait to see you again.

Harry paces back and forth when suddenly SOMETHING OCCURES
TO HIM.

100.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Wait a minute...

LLOYD
What?

HARRY
It just occurred to me. She must've
meant ten o'clock at night.

LLOYD
(brightening)
Do ya think...?

HARRY
Of course! Why would she have you
meet her at a bar at ten in the
morning?

LLOYD
(shrugging)
I just figured she was a raging
alcoholic.

Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity.

HARRY
Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?

LLOYD
I knew there was an explanation. And
here I thought she was standing me
up.

HARRY
That'll teach you to jump to
conclusions.
(beat)
Anyway, since you have your night
all

planned, I think I'll run out and catch a flick.

As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his
fist and glares after him. Then he regains his composure and
moves to the bar.

LLOYD
Will you join me in a good luck toast
before you head out?

101.

HARRY
(o.s.)
Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee
and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make
sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF
EX-LAX.

LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN.

WHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND
TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE-

take.

LLOYD
Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't
you?

HARRY
Uh... it's for mature audiences. I
on't wanna chance getting turned
away at the door.

LLOYD
I see.

Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his
own glass.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
To my friend Harry the matchmaker.

Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway.
HARRY
Mmmmm...

He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK.

CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

Harry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in
anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL
RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach.

102.

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's
walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS
THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets
his insides under control, and continues to the front porch,
where he RINGS the bell.

Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.

MARY
Hi. Come on in.

INT. SWANSON CHALET

Harry follows her inside.

MARY
Make yourself at home. I'm almost
ready. Just give me one more minute.

As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET
STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and
rushes inside.

INT. BATHROOM

HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and
nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he
does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW
to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he
hears a KNOCK on the door.

MARY
(o.s.)
Are you in there, Harry?
HARRY
(nervously)
Be right out.

MARY
(o.s.)
I hope you're not using the toilet.
It's broken.

ZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible
SWEAT breaks out on his forehead.

HARRY
Huh?

103.

MARY
(o.s.)
It doesn't flush.

HARRY
Um, no, I was just... shaving.

EXT. HALLWAY

A confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door.

MARY
Shaving?

HARRY
(o.s.)
Yeah! I was running a little late.
Thought this would save time.

MARY
Okay. Well I'll be in the living
room whenever you're ready.

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the
toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves.

HARRY
(under breath)
Come on, flush, you bastard...

EXT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.
She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.
ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing
the CAMERA gravely:

REPORTER
We'll be back in a minute with the
story of the blind Indiana boy who
was duped into buying a dead parakeet.

We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in
his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head
Scotch taped on its body.

BLIND BOY
...I thought he was real quiet...

104.

The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.
Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly
the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door.

HER POV - a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen-
chic clothes.

MARY
Yes...?

LLOYD
Hi.
(beat)
Don't you remember me?

MARY
Um... I'm not really...

LLOYD
South Bend. I drove you to the airport
last week.

MARY
(dawning on her)
Oh my god. Lloyd, right?

Lloyd is thrilled at this.

LLOYD
You remembered.

MARY
What are you doing in Aspen?

LLOYD
I brought you your briefcase You
left it at the airport so I picked
it up for you.

Mary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN.

MARY
You're the one who took my briefcase?

LLOYD
Yeah, it's back at my hotel room.
Come on, let's take a ride. I'll
give it to you.

Mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for
Harry.

MARY
Wait right here.

105.

She goes to the bathroom door. Inside we hear the LOUD
CLANKING of metal against metal.

MARY (CONT'D)
Harry, what are you doing in there?

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got the eintire toilet completely DISASSEMBLED now.
Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including
the big plastic float ball. He's on his knees tinkering with
some pipes coming out of the wall.

HARRY
Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give
me a minute, Mary, I'll be right
with you.

MARY
(o.s.)
Sorry, but something important's
come up and I have to run out. It's
sort of an emergency. I'll explain
later.

HARRY
But Mary --

MARY
(o.s.)
--I'm really sorry, Harry. I promise
we'll do this another time.

Harry hears her FOOTSTEPS echo down the hallway and then the
front DOOR CLOSING. Harry slumps against the sink, defeated.
HARRY
Great...

CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S JAGUAR - NIGHT

Lloyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, SATISFIED
SMILE. An anxious looking Mary is at the wheel.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

The Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel. As Lloyd and Mary
get out, we PAN OVER to reveal that they were being followed
by Nicholas Andre and J.P. Shay in a Mercedes.

106.

INT. ANDRE'S MERCEDES

Andre pulls a PISTOL from beneath his seat and slips it into
his coat.

ANDRE
They're mine...

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

The door opens and Lloyd and Mary ENTER.

LLOYD
..So anyway, as soon as I got to
town I tried to look you up but I
idn't know your last name.

He leads her to the closed BRIEFCASE which is sitting on the
bed.

MARY
I don't believe it. You really have
it.

LLOYD
'Course I have it. When Lloyd
Christmas drives a woman to the
airport, he makes sure she gets all
her luggage, no matter what he has
to

o.

Mary looks at Lloyd and smiles.

MARY
This is incredible. You mean to say
you drove two thousand miles just
for me?

LLOYD
Well... no... I mean, you know, there
were other reasons...
(beat)
Actually, yeah, I guess I did.

She can't believe her ears.

MARY
That is the sweetest thing I've ever
heard.

107.

He drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the
cheek.

CUT TO:

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

A sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel.

HARRY
(MUMBLING to himself)
It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw
your best friend over and it's gonna
come back to haunt you, plain and
simple...

CUT TO:

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

CLOSE ON LLOYD'S FACE - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills
his guts.

LLOYD
Look, Mary, I know this may seem a
little sudden but I've given it a
lot of thought: You're the woman
I've been waiting for my whole life,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it --
(holds up his hand)
--Please, let me finish.
(DEEP BREATH)
I'm crazy about you. I've never felt
this way about anyone. You make it
so easy for me to tell you my
innermost desires.
(NERVOUS LAUGH)
Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy
again.
(beat)
A schoolboy who desperately wants to
make sweet, sweet love to you.

Suddenly we hear   TOILET FLUSHING O.S.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS that Lloyd has been talking to an EMPTY
CHAIR. The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out. She looks
around, expecting to see someone else.

MARY
Oh... I thought I heard you talking
to someone.

108.

Lloyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of
truth.

LLOYD
Mary...
(BLURTING OUT)
I desperately want to make love to a
schoolboy.

MARY
(taken aback)
Maybe I should be going now.

LLOYD
No, that's not what Imeant. I meant...
I really like you, Mary. I like you
a lot.

She smiles at this.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
I'm gonna ask you something flat out
and I want you to answer me honestly:
What do you think the chances are of
a girl like you and a guy like me
ending up together?

Mary is obviously thrown by this question.

MARY
Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I

mean we hardly --

LLOYD
--I asked you to be honest, Mary.
MARY
But Lloyd, I really can't --

LLOYD
--Come    on, give it to me straight. I
rove a    long way to see you, the least
you can    do is level with me. What
are my    chances?

MARY
Not good.

BEAT

LLOYD
You mean not good, like one out of a
hundred?

109.

MARY
I'd say more like one out of a
million.

BEAT

LLOYD
(Duh)
So you're telling me there's a chance?

Just then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it,
he's face to face with Nicholas Andre.

MARY
Nicholas... what are you doing here?

ANDRE
I've been looking for you, Mary.

I've got some interesting news about your husband.

Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated.

LLOYD
Husband?

ANDRE
Aren't you two going to invite me
in?

Lloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A
GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL DANBURY - LOBBY - NIGHT
As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT:

WOMAN'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Hey!

Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching.

HARRY
You...? What are you doing here?

CUT TO:

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

Nicholas Andre has his gun pointed at a stunned Lloyd and
Mary.

110.

ANDRE
Well at least you two got to say
your goodbyes.

LLOYD
Who are you?

ANDRE
Don't play dumb with me, asshole.
I'm the rightful ower of that
briefcase you've been carrying.

LLOYD
Uh-oh.

Mary can't believe what's happening.

MARY
Nicholas, you... you motherfucker!
My family trusted you!

ANDRE
Shut up!

LLOYD
Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want
you to know, my friend Harry and I
have every intention of reimbursing
you.

Andre looks alarmed. He motions Mary to the briefcase with
his gun.

ANDRE
Open that damn thing!
Mary opens the briefcase and a pile of WHITE, CRUMPLED-UP
BALLS OF PAPER fall out along with a few packets of hundreds.

ANDRE (CONT'D)
What the hell's this? Where's all
the money?

LLOYD
That's as good as money, sir. Those
are our IOUs. You can add them up
yourself. Every penny's accounted
for.

Andre looks like his head is about to BURST in anger.

ANDRE
You're fucking dead!

111.

LLOYD
Now don't do anything hasty, man.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the
Presidential Suite.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

Harry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT:

HARRY
Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta
talk, man. I have a serious confession
to make.

Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD.

HIS POV - Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms
handcuffed to the bedpost.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Oh good, you found her. I'll just
leave you two kids alone.

Harry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN.

ANDRE
Why don't you stay and join the party?

CUT TO:

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed. Nicholas
Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he SPEAKS on the
phone:

ANDRE
..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De
Janerio departing as soon as
possible...

ON THE BED - Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the
eye.

MARY
You mean you two know each other?

112.

LLOYD
(cutting)
Yeah, we used to be best friends.

HARRY
Until he turned into a backstabber.

LLOYD
Me a backstabber? You got a lot of
nerve. I saw her first.

HARRY
Hey, I couldn't help it if she found
me irresistable.

Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.

LLOYD
But you knew how crazy I was about
her.

HARRY
Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was
about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't
stop you, did it?

LLOYD
(waning righteousness)
What are you talking about?

HARRY
Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me
the whole sordid story.

Lloyd can't muster a defense.
LLOYD
Look... I was gonna tell you about
that. It was gonna be mentioned at
the reading of my will. I swear, you
can ask my lawyer.

Harry glares at him.

HARRY
Well I guess we both learned a little
something about each other, didn't
we?

LLOYD
You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as
good friends as we thought we were.

113.

HARRY
Guess not.

LLOYD
I mean, if one beautiful girl   could
rip us apart like this, then   it seems
our friendship isn't worth a   damn.
(beat)
Maybe we should call it quits   right
here.

HARRY
Just tell me where to sign, bud.

Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING
COCKED.

ANDRE
Okay, which one of you losers wants
to die first?

The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.

HARRY
I wouldn't pull that trigger if I
were you.

ANDRE
Why not? It'll look like just another
Aspen love triangle. You caught the
two of them in bed, handcuffed them
to the post, murdered them, and killed
yourself.

HARRY
(smug)
Except you're forgetting one minor
etail.

ANDRE
What's that?

Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.

HARRY
If you kill us, you'd be killing
yourself.

ANDRE
(puzzled)
Huh?

114.

HARRY
You see, philosophers believe that
we're all really just tiny pieces of
one huge universal being. In other
words, I am you and you are me, so
if you were to kill us you'd be
committing suicide, you unenlightened

idiot --

ANDRE
--Shut up!

Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.

MARY
What about my husband? Did you kill
him, too?

HARRY
Husband? What husband?

LLOYD
Mary's married, Harry.

ANDRE
No need to worry about Melvin.
(beat)
Now this is the last time I'll ask:
Who wants to die first?

Harry gestures with his head at Mary.

HARRY
Kill her. The bitch should've told
him she was married back at the
airport. It would've saved us a lot
of trouble.

Andre points the gun at Mary.

LLOYD
No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the
one who got you into this mess.

Andre points the gun at Lloyd.

HARRY
No, wait, do me first. I'm the one
who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve
it.

115.

Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and
Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his
stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.

LLOYD
Jesus Christ! You killed my best
friend, you bastard!

Andre smiles.

ANDRE
If it's any consolation, you're about
to be reunited.

He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a
SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.

ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
at the stunned Nicholas Andre.

LLOYD
Harry! You're alive!

Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS
storm in with their weapons drawn.

COP #1
Get your hands up, asshole!

Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned
Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He
reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted
by the turn of events.

There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way
through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She
flashes an ID.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

LLOYD
(dumbstruck)
You gotta be kidding.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Good work, Harry.

Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt,
revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.

116.

HARRY
She grabbed me down in the lobby and
explained what was up. They slapped
this on me and gave me a gun.

LLOYD
(to Athletic Beauty)
But how did you...?

ATHLETIC   BEAUTY
We've been following   you two all the
way from Providence.   Mr. and Mrs.
Swanson had a homing   device plated
in the briefcase.

The guys glance guiltily at one another.

HARRY
Yeah, about that dough...

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Every bill was counterfeit and marked.

Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are
hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS
to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.

LLOYD
She's something, ain't she, Har?
HARRY
You were right, Lloyd. She was
efinitely worth the trip.

LLOYD
Guess we have to admit it, she was
too good for us.

Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.

MELVIN
Oh god, baby, I missed you!

Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.

117.

MELVIN (CONT'D)
I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
was so darn dank in that well, I
really thought it would be the death
of me.

Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at
each other, and we

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY

Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,
Barnard.

HARRY
Hey, Barney...

BELL CAPTAIN
Yes, gentlemen?

LLOYD
Look, we just wanted to say that we
appreciate all you did for us during
our stay.

HARRY
And we're, um, sorry about the money
we gave you turning out to be phony.
BELL CAPTAIN
Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
Swanson family has promised to
reimburse everyone.

This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered
to the front door.

LLOYD
Well, anyway, thanks again for
everything.

They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:

BARNARD
Where are you two headed?

118.

HARRY
I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
camp somewhere to call home.

BARNARD
Why not right here?

Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.

LLOYD
This joint is a little out of our
budget, Barney.

BARNARD
(smiling)
Oh, I think we might be able to find
you a free room somewhere -- after
all, like you once told me, we're
all from the same mold.
(winks)
You just don't have any dough right
now.

The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.

HARRY
Are you on the level?

BARNARD
Absolutely. We'll just slide you
into one of the employee rooms...

The guys beam at this.

BARNARD (CONT'D)
...Provided, of course, you don't
mind working one or two afternoons a
week.

Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:

LLOYD
You know what, Barney, I think we'll
take out chances down the road.

Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:

119.

HARRY
(v.o.)
Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,
what next, lloyd?

LLOYD
(v.o.)
I say we head due south and try a
little nose-rubbing with some of
them slinky eskimo babes.

HARRY
(v.o.)
Now you're talking my language. You
know I got a weakness for blondes.

As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS
UP, UP, UP...

INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS

A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings
open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet
again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off
the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to
the camera, phone in hand.

FIGURE
(groggily)
Hello... What?... No, I don't work
today... I'm playing hockey at two.

THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

FIGURE (O.S.)
Why don't you call Randal?... Because
I'm fucking tired... I just closed
last night...
(deep sigh)
Jesus... What time are you going to
come in?... Twelve... Be there be
twelve?... Swear...

A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

FIGURE (O.S.)
Swear you'll be in by twelve and
I'll do it... Twelve... Twelve or I
walk.

THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
and stands.

THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's
life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

DANTE
Next time, I get the bed.

He releases the dog and sits up.

DANTE
(exhausted)
Shit.

CUT TO:

INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER

A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
the toilet.

CUT TO:

INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER

A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

CUT TO:

INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER

Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

CUT TO:

INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER

DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

CUT TO:

INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER

DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
atop a VCR.

CUT TO:

EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER

A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

CUT TO:

DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
store.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a knife.
Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack remains
empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.

Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
his eyes as it occurs to him.

DANTE
Shit.

The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE

Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches
toward the camera.

DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
looks down at it.

DANTE
Shit!

The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive
like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.  DANTE
looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car trunk
pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded
white sheet.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet
under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I ASSURE
YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

DANTE
Thanks. Have a good one.

ACTIVIST
Do you mind if I drink this here?

DANTE
Sure. Go ahead.

The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.

Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

CUSTOMER
Are you open?

DANTE
Yeah.

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes.

ACTIVIST
Are you sure?

CUSTOMER
Am I sure?

ACTIVIST
Are you sure?

CUSTOMER
Am I sure about what?

ACTIVIST
Do you really want to buy those
cigarettes?

CUSTOMER
Are you serious?

ACTIVIST
How long have you been smoking?

CUSTOMER
(to DANTE)
What is this, a poll?

DANTE
Beats me.

ACTIVIST
How long have you been a smoker?

CUSTOMER
Since I was thirteen.

The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

ACTIVIST
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty,
am I right?

CUSTOMER
What the hell is that?

ACTIVIST
That's your lung. By this time, your
lung looks like this.

CUSTOMER
You're shittin' me.

ACTIVIST
You think I'm shitting you...

The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

CUSTOMER
What's this?

ACTIVIST
It's a trach ring. It's what they
install in your throat when throat
cancer takes your voice box. This
one came out of a sixty-year-old
man.

CUSTOMER
(drops ring)
Unnhh!

ACTIVIST
(picks up the ring)
He smoked until the day he died.
Used to put the cigarette in this
thing and smoke it that way.

DANTE
Excuse me, but...

ACTIVIST
This is where you're heading. A cruddy
lung, smoking through a hole in your
throat. Do you really want that?

CUSTOMER
Well, if it's already too late...

ACTIVIST
It's never too late. Give those
cigarettes back now, and buy some
gum instead.
(grabs nearby pack,
reads)
Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

CUSTOMER
It's not the same.

ACTIVIST
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it
certainly beats this.

Hands him a picture.

CUSTOMER
Jesus!

ACTIVIST
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
lung. Keep it.

CUSTOMER
(to DANTE)
I'll just take the gum.

DANTE
Fifty-five.

ACTIVIST
You've made a wise choice. Keep up
the good work.

The CUSTOMER exits.

DANTE
Maybe you should take that coffee
outside.

ACTIVIST
No, I think I'll drink it in here,
thanks.

DANTE
If you're going to drink it in here,
I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother
the customers.

ACTIVIST
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes.
(looks at model)
What's that?

ACTIVIST
This? How long have you been smoking?

BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance,
spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

JAY
WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!

SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

JAY
I feel good today, Silent Bob. We're
gonna make some money! And then you
know what we're going to do? We're
going to go to that party and get
some pussy! I'm gonna fuck this bitch,
that bitch...
(Blue Velvet Hopper)
I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!

SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.

JAY
(to O.C.)
What you looking at?! I'll kick your
fucking ass!
(to SILENT BOB)
Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
me ten bucks?

SILENT BOB nods.

JAY
Tonight, you and me are going off
that fucker's head, and take out his
fucking soul! Remind me if he tries
to buy something from us, to cut it
with leafs and twigs... or fucking
shit in the motherfucker's bag!

Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.

JAY
Wa sup sluts?
(to SILENT BOB)
Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
motherfucker! But you're cute as
hell.
(slowly drops to knees)
I wanna go down on you, and suckle
you.
(makes blow job neck-
jerks)
And then, I wanna line up three more
guys, and make like a circus seal...

JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

JAY
Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I fucking
hate guys!
(yelling)
I LOVE WOMEN!
(calmer)
Neh.

A GUY comes up to them.

GUY
You selling?

JAY
(all business)
I got hits, hash, weed, and later on
I'll have 'shrooms. We take cash, or
stolen MasterCard and Visa.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
has become something of a rally.

ACTIVIST
You're spending what? Twenty, thirty
dollars a week on cigarettes.

LISTENER 1
Forty.

LISTENER 2
Fifty-three.

ACTIVIST
Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
someone that much money every week
to kill you? Because that's what
you're doing now, by paying for the
so-called privilege to smoke!

LISTENER 3
We all gotta go sometime...

ACTIVIST
It's that kind of mentality that
allows this cancer-producing industry
to thrive. Of course we're all going
to die someday, but do we have to
pay for it? Do we have to actually
throw hard-earned dollars on a counter
and say, "Please, please, Mister
Merchant of Death, sir; please sell
me something that will give me bad
breath, stink up my clothes, and fry
my lungs."

LISTENER 1
It's not that easy to quit.

ACTIVIST
Of course it's not; not when you
have people like this mindless cretin
so happy and willing to sell you
nails for your coffin!

DANTE
Hey, now wait a sec...

ACTIVIST
Now he's going to launch into his
rap about how he's just doing his
job; following orders.  Friends, let
me tell you about another bunch of
hate mongers that were just following
orders: they were called Nazis, and
they practically wiped a nation of
people from the Earth... just like
cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
smoking is the new Holocaust, and
those that partake in the practice
of smoking or sell the wares that
promote it are the Nazis of the
nineties! He doesn't care how many
people die from it! He smiles as you
pay for your cancer sticks and says,
"Have a nice day."

DANTE
I think you'd better leave now.

ACTIVIST
You want me to leave? Why? Because
somebody is telling it like it is?
Somebody's giving these fine people
a wake-up call?!

DANTE
You're loitering in here, and causing
a disturbance.

ACTIVIST
You're the disturbance, pal! And
here...
(slaps a dollar on
the counter)
I'm buying some... what's this?...
Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer
loitering. I'm a customer, a customer
engaged in a discussion with other
customers.

LISTENER 2
(to DANTE)
Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!

ACTIVIST
Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
threat we present! He smells the
changes coming, and the loss of sales
when the nonsmokers finally demand
satisfaction. We demand the right to
breathe cleaner air!

LISTENER 3
Yeah!

ACTIVIST
We'd rather chew our gum than embrace
slow death! Let's abolish this heinous
practice of sucking poison, and if
it means ruffling the feathers of a
convenience store idiot, then so be
it!

DANTE
That's it, everybody out.

ACTIVIST
We're not moving! We have a right, a
constitutional right, to assemble
and be heard!

DANTE
Yeah, but not in here.

ACTIVIST
What better place than this? To stamp
it out, you gotta start at the source!

DANTE
Like I'm responsible for all the
smokers!

ACTIVIST
The ones in this town, yes! You
encourage their growth, their habit.
You're the source in this area, and
we're going to shut you down for
good! For good, cancer-merchant!

The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

CROWD
Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
Cancer merchant!

VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
throng. Everyone turns to face...

VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
a fire extinguisher.

VERONICA
Who's leading this mob?

The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

SOMEONE
That guy.

The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
the door.

VERONICA (O.S.)
Freeze.

VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

VERONICA
Let's see some credentials.

He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
nozzle at him, warningly.

VERONICA
Slowly...

He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
it.

VERONICA
You're a Chewlie's Gum representative?

He nods.

VERONICA
And you're stirring up all this
antismoking sentiment to... what?...
sell more gum?

He nods again.

VERONICA
(through gritted teeth)
Get out of here.

He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
exits.

VERONICA
(to the crowd)
And you people: Don't you have jobs
to go to? Get out of here and go
commute.

The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

VERONICA
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
Easily led automatons. Try thinking
for yourself before you pelt and
innocent man with cigarettes.

The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
floor, head in his folded arms.

VERONICA
It looked like Tiananmen Square in
here for a second.

DANTE is silent.

VERONICA
"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
from an extremely ugly mob scene."

DANTE remains silent.

VERONICA
(sits beside him)
Okay, champ. What's wrong?

DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

VERONICA
All right, stupid question. But don't
you think you're taking this a bit
too hard?

DANTE
Too hard?! I don't have enough
indignities in my life-people start
throwing cigarettes at me!

VERONICA
At least they weren't lit.

DANTE
I hate this fucking place.

VERONICA
Then quit. You should be going to
school anyway...

DANTE
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
is a lecture at this point.

VERONICA
All I'm saying is that if you're
unhappy you should leave.

DANTE
I'm not even supposed to be here
today!

VERONICA
I know. I stopped by your house and
your mom said you left at like six
or something.

DANTE
The guy got sick and couldn't come
in.

VERONICA
Don't you have a hockey game at two?

DANTE
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit
because I didn't get a good night's
sleep!

VERONICA
Why did you agree to come in then?

DANTE
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm
gone. The boss is coming in.

VERONICA
Why don't you open the shutters and
get some sunlight in here?

DANTE
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

VERONICA
You're kidding.

DANTE
Bunch of savages in this town.

VERONICA
You look bushed. What time did you
get to bed?

DANTE
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

VERONICA
What were you doing up so late?

DANTE
(skirting)
Hunhh? Nothing.

VERONICA
(persistent)
What were you doing?

DANTE
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
you now?

VERONICA
Who's fighting? Why are you so
defensive?

DANTE
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you
just hug me?! All right? Your
boyfriend was accosted by an angry
mob, and he needs to be hugged.

She stares at him.

DANTE
What? What is that?

VERONICA
She called you, didn't she?

DANTE
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you
please hug me?  I just went through
a very traumatic experience and I
haven't been having the best day so
far. Now come on.

VERONICA stares at him.

DANTE
What? What's with that look?! I wasn't
talking to anyone, especially her!
Look at you, being all sort of... I
don't know... stand-offish.

VERONICA looks away.

DANTE
Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
me. I see how it is. All right Pissy-
pants, you just go on being suspicious
and quiet. I don't even want to hug
you at this point.

VERONICA looks back at him.

DANTE
(pleadingly)
Give you a dollar?

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN
APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.

DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

DANTE
(to O.C. customer)
Thanks.

The door is heard opening and closing - a customer leaving.

VERONICA
How much money did you leave up there?

DANTE
Like three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles. People only
get the paper of coffee this time of
morning.

VERONICA
You're trusting.

DANTE
Why do you say that?

VERONICA
How do you know they're taking the
right amount of change? Or even paying
for what they take?

DANTE
Theoretically, people see money on
the counter and nobody around, they
think they're being watched.

VERONICA
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you
smell like shoe polish?

DANTE
I had to use shoe polish to make
that sign. The smell won't come off.

VERONICA
Do you think anyone can see us down
here?

DANTE
Why? You wanna have sex or something?

VERONICA
(sarcastic)
Ooh! Can we?!

DANTE
Really?

VERONICA
I was kidding.

DANTE
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of
me.

VERONICA
Typically male point of view.

DANTE
How do you figure?

VERONICA
You show some bedroom proficiency,
and you think you're gods. What about
what we do for you?

DANTE
Women? Women, as lovers, are all
basically the same: they just have
to be there.

VERONICA
"Be there?"

DANTE
Making a male climax is not all that
challenging: insert somewhere close
and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.

VERONICA
How flattering.

DANTE
Now, making a woman cum... therein
lies a challenge.

VERONICA
Oh, you think so?

DANTE
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard.
A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.

VERONICA
And I actually date you?

DANTE
Something wrong?

VERONICA
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
it takes more than that to get a guy
off. Just "being there"-as you put
it-is not enough.

DANTE
I touched a nerve.

VERONICA
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize
my role in our sex life.

DANTE
It wasn't directed at you. I was
making a broad generalization.

VERONICA
You were making a generalization
about "broads!"

DANTE
These are my opinions based on my
experiences with the few women who
were good enough to sleep with me.

VERONICA
How many?

DANTE
How many what?

VERONICA
How many girls have you slept with?

DANTE
How many different girls? Didn't we
already have this discussion once?

VERONICA
We might have; I don't remember.
How many?

DANTE
Including you?

VERONICA
It better be up to and including me.

DANTE
(pause to count)
Twelve.

VERONICA
You've slept with twelve different
girls?

DANTE
Including you; yes.

Pause. She slaps him.

DANTE
What the hell was that for?

VERONICA
You're a pig.

DANTE
Why'd you hit me?

VERONICA
Do you know how many different men
I've had sex with?

DANTE
Do I get to hit you after you tell
me?

VERONICA
Three.

DANTE
Three?

VERONICA
Three including you.

DANTE
You've only had sex with three
different people?

VERONICA
I'm not the pig you are.

DANTE
Who?

VERONICA
You!

DANTE
No; who were the three, besides me?

VERONICA
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

DANTE
(with true admiration)
Wow. That's great. That's something
to be proud of.

VERONICA
I am. And that's why you should feel
like a pig. You men make me sick.
You'll sleep with anything that says
yes.

DANTE
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.

VERONICA
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

DANTE
They put up the least amount of
struggle.

VERONICA
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me. Big.

DANTE
All right. Name it.

VERONICA
I want you to come with me on Monday.

DANTE
Where?

VERONICA
To school. There's a seminar about
getting back into a scholastic program
after a lapse in enrollment.

DANTE
Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up?

VERONICA
It's important to me, Dante. You
have so much potential that just
goes to waste in this pit. I wish
you'd go back to school.

DANTE
Jesus, would you stop? You make my
head hurt when you talk about this.

VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

DANTE
Shit! Why are we getting up?

VERONICA
Unlike you, I have a class in forty-
five minutes.

A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
VERONICA reacts to him.

VERONICA
(surprised)
Willam!

WILLAM
Ronnie! How are you? You work here
now?

VERONICA
(locks arms with DANTE)
No, I'm just visiting my man.
(to DANTE)
Dante, this is Willam Black.
(to WILLAM)
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

DANTE
How are you? Just the soda?

WILLAM
And a pack of cigarettes.
(to VERONICA; paying)
Are you still going to Seton Hall?

VERONICA
No, I transferred into Monmouth this
year. I was tired of missing him.
(squeezes DANTE'S arm)

WILLAM
Do you still talk to Sylvan?

VERONICA
I just talked to her on Monday. We
still hang out on weekends.

WILLAM
(leaving)
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
take it easy, all right?

VERONICA
I will. Take it easy.

WILLAM
Bye.
(exits)

VERONICA
Bye
(to DANTE)
That was Snowball.

DANTE
Why do you call him that?

VERONICA
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
thing.

DANTE
What do you mean?

VERONICA
After he gets a blow job, he likes
to have the cum spit back into his
mouth while kissing. It's called
snowballing.

DANTE
He requested this?

VERONICA
He gets off on it.

DANTE
Sylvan can be talked into anything.

VERONICA
Why do you say that?

DANTE
Like you said-she snowballed him.

VERONICA
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

DANTE
Yeah, right.

VERONICA
I'm serious...

A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

DANTE
You sucked that guy's dick?

VERONICA
Yeah. How do you think I know he
liked...

DANTE
(panicky)
But... but you said you only had sex
with three guys! You never mentioned
him!

VERONICA
That's because I never had sex with
him!

DANTE
You sucked his dick!

VERONICA
We went out a few times. We didn't
have sex, but we fooled around.

DANTE
(massive panic attack)
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
only slept with three guys?

VERONICA
Because I did only sleep with three
guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
just go with people.

DANTE
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

VERONICA
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
understood.

DANTE
I did understand! I understand that
you slept with three different guys,
and that's all you said.

VERONICA
Please calm down.

DANTE
How many?

VERONICA
Dante...

DANTE
How many dicks have you sucked?!

VERONICA
Let it go...

DANTE
HOW MANY?

VERONICA
All right! Shut up a second and I'll
tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like
this when you told me how many girls
you fucked.

DANTE
This is different. This is important.
How many?!

She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

DANTE
Well...?

VERONICA
(half-mumbled)
Something like thirty-six.

DANTE
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?

VERONICA
Lower your voice!

DANTE
What the hell is that anyway,
"something like thirty-six?" Does
that include me?

VERONICA
Um. Thirty-seven.

DANTE
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?

VERONICA
(walking away)
I'm going to class.

DANTE
Thirty-seven?!
(to CUSTOMER)
My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
dicks!

CUSTOMER
In a row?

DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

DANTE
Hey! Where are you going?!

VERONICA
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
never even knew how many guys I'd
slept with, because you never even
asked. And then you act all nonchalant
about fucking twelve different girls.
Well, I never had sex with twelve
different guys!

DANTE
No, but you sucked enough dick!

VERONICA
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...

DANTE
A few?

VERONICA
...And one of those guys was you!
The last one, I might add, which-if
you're too stupid to comprehend-
means that I've been faithful to you
since we met! All the other guys I
went with before I met you, so, if
you want to have a complex about it,
go ahead!  But don't look at me like
I'm the town whore, because you were
plenty busy yourself, before you met
me!

DANTE
(a bit more rational)
Well... why did you have to suck
their dicks? Why didn't you just
sleep with them, like any decent
person?!

VERONICA
Because going down it's a big deal!
I used to like a guy, we'd make out,
and sooner or later I'd go down on
him. But I only had sex with the
guys I loved.

DANTE
I feel sick.

VERONICA
(holds him)
I love you. Don't feel sick.

DANTE
Every time I kiss you now I'm going
to taste thirty-six other guys.

VERONICA violently lets go of him.

VERONICA
I'm going to school. Maybe later
you'll be a bit more rational.

DANTE
(pause)
Thirty-seven. I just can't...

VERONICA
Goodbye, Dante.

She exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a
moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out.

DANTE
Try not to suck any more dicks on
your way through the parking lot!

Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside
double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went.

DANTE
HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE!

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips
repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making
a strong attempt at not noticing the glare.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
(pissed off)
I thought that place was supposed to
be opened at eleven o'clock?

It's twenty after!

DANTE
I called his house twice already.

He should be here soon.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
It's not like it's a demanding job.
I'd like to get paid to sit on my
ass and watch TV. The other day I
walked in there and that sonofabitch
was sleeping.

DANTE
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
You calling me a liar?

DANTE
No; he was probably just resting his
eyes.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
What the hell is that? Resting his
eyes! It's not like he's some
goddamned air traffic controller!

DANTE
Actually, that's his night job.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack
wise. That's why you're jockeying a
register in some fucking local
convenience store instead of doing
an honest day's work.
(tosses tape on counter)
I got no more time to bullshit around
waiting for that sonofabitch.  You
make sure this gets back. The number's
eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted
to get a damn movie, too.

DANTE
If you'll just tell me the title of
your rental choice, I'll have him
hold it for you.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
(storming out)
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to
Big Choice Video instead.

He storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter.

DANTE
(in a whisper)
You forgot your keys.

The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store
door. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at
the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug.

V.A. CUSTOMER
The guy ain't here yet.

RANDAL
You're kidding. It's almost eleven-
thirty!

V.A. CUSTOMER
I know. I've been here since eleven.

RANDAL
(kicks the door)
Man! I hate it when I can't rent
videos!

V.A. CUSTOMER
I would've went to Big Choice, but
the tape I want is right there on
the wall.

RANDAL
Which one?

V.A. CUSTOMER
Dental School.

RANDAL
You came for that too? That's the
movie I came for.

V.A. CUSTOMER
I have first dibs.

RANDAL
Says who?

V.A. CUSTOMER
(suddenly snotty)
Says me. I've been here for half an
hour. I'd call that first dibs.

RANDAL
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm
getting that tape.

V.A. CUSTOMER
Like hell you are!

RANDAL
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't
get to rent that tape.

V.A. CUSTOMER
Twenty bucks?

RANDAL
Twenty bucks.

V.A. CUSTOMER
All right, asshole, you're on.

RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a
sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
You see a pair of keys lying around
here somewhere?

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

RANDAL dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine. He sees
DANTE and stops dead, midshuffle.

DANTE
You're late.

RANDAL
What the hell are you doing here? I
thought you were playing hockey at
one.

DANTE
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

RANDAL
Why are the shutters closed?

DANTE
Someone jammed gum in the locks.

RANDAL
Bunch of savages in this town.

DANTE
That's what I said.

RANDAL
Shit, if I'd known you were working,
I would've come even later.

A pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a
single key on top. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his
head.

RANDAL
What time do you have to stay till?

DANTE
He assured me that he'd be here by
twelve.

RANDAL
What smells like shoe polish?

DANTE
Go open the sore.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stops RANDAL.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
Hey-did you see a set of keys lying
around here?

RANDAL
(as Short-round)
No time for love, Doctor Jones!

RANDAL marches off. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
Fucking kids.

The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to
the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves
the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as
RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to
be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later.
RANDAL smiles.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone
heaps ground coffee on it. We've seen this same routine
before. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters,
tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He
picks the cat up.

RANDAL
Some guy just came in refusing to
pay late fees. He said the store was
closed for two hours yesterday.  I
tore up his membership.

DANTE
Shocking abuse of authority.

RANDAL
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy
of a ruling class, especially since
I rule.
(furtively)
Is the Pelican flying?

DANTE
Don't screw with it. It makes us
look suspicious.

RANDAL
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.

RANDAL heads toward the walk-in door.

CUT TO:

INT: BACK ROOM. DAY

POV: VCR

A far-away wall is the only thing we see, but mild gruntings
give away an ascension of sorts. RANDAL'S head rises into
view, as if he's climbing a ladder. He stops and looks into
the lens.

POV: RANDAL

The PELICAN is a VCR that's hooked up to a surveillance
camera. It records quickly. A hand reaches into the frame
and shuts it off.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

RANDAL pulls a soda from the cooler.

RANDAL
Want something to drink? I'm buying.

DANTE (O.S.)
No, thanks.

RANDAL
Who was on your phone this morning
at about two-thirty? I was trying to
call for a half an hour.

DANTE (O.S.)
Why?

RANDAL
I wanted to use your car.

He walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at
it.

RANDAL
Snake cake?

DANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a
paper and joins him behind the counter.

DANTE
You don't want to know.

RANDAL
You called Caitlin again?

DANTE
She called me.

RANDAL
Did you tell Veronica?

DANTE
One fight a day with Veronica is
about all I can stomach, thanks.

RANDAL
What do you two fight about?

DANTE
I guess it's not really fighting.
She just wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction.

RANDAL
(opening paper)
I'll bet the most frequent topic of
arguments is Caitlin Bree.

DANTE
You win.

RANDAL
I'm going to offer you some advice,
my friend: let the past be the past.
Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been
with Veronica for how long now?

DANTE
Seven months.

RANDAL
Chick's nuts about you. How long did
you date Caitlin?

DANTE
Five years.

RANDAL
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated
on you how many times?

DANTE
Eight and a half.

RANDAL
(looks up from paper)
Eight and a half?

DANTE
Party at John K's-senior year. I get
blitzed and pass out in his bedroom.
Caitlin comes in and dives all over
me.

RANDAL
That's cheating?

DANTE
In the middle of it, she calls me
Brad.

RANDAL
She called you Brad?

DANTE
She called me Brad.

RANDAL
That's not cheating. People say crazy
shit during sex. One time, I called
this girl "Mom."

DANTE
I hit the lights and she freaks.
Turns out she thought I was Brad
Michaelson.

RANDAL
What do you mean?

DANTE
She was supposed to meet Brad
Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked
the wrong one. She had no idea I was
even at the party.

RANDAL
Oh, my God.

DANTE
Great story, isn't it?

RANDAL
That girl was vile to you.

DANTE
Interesting postscript to that story:
Do you know who wound up going with
Brad Michaelson in the other dark
bedroom?

RANDAL
Your mother.

DANTE
Allan Harris.

RANDAL
Chess team Allan Harris?!

DANTE
The two moved to Idaho together after
graduation. They raise sheep.

RANDAL
That's frightening.

DANTE
It takes different strokes to move
the world.

RANDAL
In light of this lurid tale, I don't
see how you could even romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin-she
broke your heart and inadvertently
drove men to deviant lifestyles.

DANTE
Because there was a lot of good in
our relationship.

RANDAL
Oh yeah.

DANTE
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.  That's what
high school's all about-algebra, bad
lunch, and infidelity.

RANDAL
You think things would be any
different now?

DANTE
They are. When she calls me now,
she's a different person-she's
frightened and vulnerable. She's
about to finish college and enter
the real world. That's got to be
scary for anyone.

RANDAL
(suddenly recalling)
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

DANTE
I'm talking to myself here.

RANDAL
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving
college, and...?

DANTE
...and she's looking to me for
support. And I think that this is
leading our relationship to a new
level.

RANDAL
What about Veronica?

DANTE
I think the arguments Veronica and I
are having are some kind of
manifestation of a subconscious desire
to break away from her so that I can
pursue the possibility of a more
meaningful relationship with Caitlin.

RANDAL
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

DANTE
I think it's safe to say yes.

RANDAL
Then I think all four of you had
better sit down and talk it over.

DANTE
All four?

RANDAL
You, Veronica, Caitlin...
(lays paper flat)
...and Caitlin's fiancé.

Usually I just turn the can upside
down.

DANTE

Maybe we should soap your hand or
something.

MAN
(straining)
They oughta put some kind of warning

The can pops off and DANTE staggers back a few steps. The

MAN
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have

DANTE
I'll throw this out. Precautionary

It stings a little.

DANTE
A word of advice: Sometimes it's
best to let those hard to reach chips

DANTE steps behind the counter.

Thanks.

away.

DANTE
Do you know that article is accurate?
Caitlin's really getting married!

RANDAL
You know what I just watched?

DANTE
Me pulling a can off some moron's
fist.

RANDAL
Return of the Jedi.

DANTE
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really
is getting married.

RANDAL
Which did you like better: Jedi or
The Empire Strikes Back.

DANTE
(exasperated)
Empire.

RANDAL
Blasphemy.

DANTE
Empire had the better ending: Luke
gets his hand cut off, and finds out
Vader's his father; Han gets frozen
and taken away by Boba Fett.  It
ends on such a down note. And that's
life-a series of down endings. All
Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

RANDAL
There was something else going on in
Jedi. I never noticed it until today.

RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

DANTE
What's that?

RANDAL
All right, Vader's boss...

DANTE
The Emperor.

RANDAL
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?

DANTE
How do you mean?

RANDAL
Well, he's like the pope for the
dark side of the Force. He's a holy
man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
evil one.

DANTE
I guess.

RANDAL
Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
The Imperial government is under his
control. And the entire galaxy is
under Imperial rule.

DANTE
Yeah.

RANDAL
Then wouldn't that logically mean
that it's a theocracy? If the head
of the Empire is a priest of some
sort, then it stands to reason that
the government is therefore one based
on religion.

DANTE
It would stand to reason, yes.

RANDAL
Hence, the Empire was a fascist
theocracy, and the rebel forces were
therefore battling religious
persecution.

DANTE
More or less.

RANDAL
The only problem is that at no point
in the series did I ever hear Leia
or any of the rebels declare a
particular religious belief.

DANTE
I think they were Catholics.

A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door.

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Are you open?

DANTE
Yeah. Come in.

He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.

RANDAL
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?

DANTE
There's more?

RANDAL
So they build another Death Star,
right?

DANTE
Yeah.

RANDAL
Now the first one they built was
completed and fully operational before
the Rebels destroyed it.

DANTE
Luke blew it up. Give credit where
it's due.

RANDAL
And the second one was still being
built when they blew it up.

DANTE
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

RANDAL
Something just never sat right with
me the second time they destroyed
it. I could never put my finger on
it-something just wasn't right.

DANTE
And you figured it out?

RANDAL
Well, the thing is, the first Death
Star was manned by the Imperial army-
storm troopers, dignitaries-the only
people onboard were Imperials.

DANTE
Basically.

RANDAL
So when they blew it up, no prob.
Evil is punished.

DANTE
And the second time around...?

RANDAL
The second time around, it wasn't
even finished yet. They were still
under construction.

DANTE
So?

RANDAL
A construction job of that magnitude
would require a helluva lot more
manpower than the Imperial army had
to offer. I'll bet there were
independent contractors working on
that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders,
roofers.

DANTE
Not just Imperials, is what you're
getting at.

RANDAL
Exactly. In order to get it built
quickly and quietly they'd hire
anybody who could do the job. Do you
think the average storm trooper knows
how to install a toilet main?  All
they know is killing and white
uniforms.

DANTE
All right, so even if independent
contractors are working on the Death
Star, why are you uneasy with its
destruction?

RANDAL
All those innocent contractors
hired to do a job were killed-
casualties of a war they had nothing
to do with.
(notices Dante's
confusion)
All right, look-you're a roofer, and
some juicy government contract comes
your way; you got the wife and kids
and the two-story in suburbia-this
is a government contract, which means
all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden
these left-wing militants blast you
with lasers and wipe out everyone
within a three-mile radius.  You
didn't ask for that. You have no
personal politics. You're just trying
to scrape out a living.

The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them.

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt,
but what were you talking about?

RANDAL
The ending of Return of the Jedi.

DANTE
My friend is trying to convince me
that any contractors working on the
uncompleted Death Star were innocent
victims when the space station was
destroyed by the rebels.

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a
roofer...
(digs into pocket and
produces business
card)
Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
And speaking as a roofer, I can say
that a roofer's personal politics
come heavily into play when choosing
jobs.

RANDAL
Like when?

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Three months ago I was offered a job
up in the hills. A beautiful house
with tons of property. It was a simple
reshingling job, but I was told that
if it was finished within a day, my
price would be doubled.  Then I
realized whose house it was.

DANTE
Whose house was it?

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Dominick Bambino's.

RANDAL
"Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
The same. The money was right, but
the risk was too big. I knew who he
was, and based on that, I passed the
job on to a friend of mine.

DANTE
Based on personal politics.

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
Right. And that week, the Foresci
family put a hit on Babyface's house.
My friend was shot and killed. He
wasn't even finished shingling.

RANDAL
No way!

BLUE-COLLAR MAN
(paying for coffee)
I'm alive because I knew there were
risks involved taking on that
particular client. My friend wasn't
so lucky.
(pauses to reflect)
You know, any contractor willing to
work on that Death Star knew the
risks. If they were killed, it was
their own fault. A roofer listens to
this...
(taps his heart)
not his wallet.

The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain
respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the
door and pokes her head in.

WOMAN

RANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the
two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to
the other repeatedly.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(attempting a solicit
help)
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was
even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different
approach.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
Are either of these any good?

RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries
harder, then louder and more direct:

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
Sir!

RANDAL continues to read.

RANDAL
(flatly)
What.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(politely)
Are either of these any good?

RANDAL, as always, reads on.

RANDAL
(again, flatly)
I don't watch movies.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put
off.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
Well, have you heard anything about
either of them?

RANDAL does his level best to not get involved.

RANDAL
(reading)
No.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(in disbelief)
You've never heard anybody say
anything about either movie?

RANDAL (O.S.)
I find it's best to stay out of other
people's affairs.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(with a new
determination)
Well, how about these two movies?
(holds up the same
two)

RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

RANDAL
They suck.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper.
She has caught him.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I just held up the same two movies.
You're not even paying attention.

RANDAL
No, I wasn't.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I don't think your manager would
appreciate...

RANDAL
(turning the page)
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
I beg your pardon!

RANDAL
(reading on)
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
trick me.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(defending herself)
I only pointed out that you weren't
paying any attention to what I was
saying.

RANDAL
(turning page and
reading)
I hope it feels good.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
You hope what feels good?

RANDAL
I hope it feels so good to be right.
There is nothing more exhilarating
than pointing out the shortcomings
of others, is there?

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto
the wall.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(in a huff)
Well this is the last time I ever
rent here...

RANDAL
You'll be missed.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
(losing it altogether)
Screw you!

She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter
and whips the door open.

RANDAL
(calling after her)
You're not allowed to rent here
anymore!

RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily, totally
appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

RANDAL
Screw me!

He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.

Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside, gives
it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the
opposite direction from the woman.

hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.

RANDAL
You'll never believe what this unruly
customer just said...

DANTE
(a hand up to urge
him to hush)
Wait.

RANDAL
(looking around)
She's in here?

DANTE
This guy is going through all of the
eggs. Look.

An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,
all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it
open, and examines each egg carefully.

DANTE (O.S.)
This has been going on for twenty
minutes.

RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

RANDAL
What's he looking for?

DANTE
He said he has to find a perfect
dozen.

RANDAL
Perfect dozen.

DANTE
Each egg has to be perfect.

RANDAL
The quest isn't going well?

DANTE
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons
that didn't make the grade.

The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
several different angles.

RANDAL (O.S.)
Why doesn't he just mix and match?

DANTE
I told him that and he yelled at me.

RANDAL snickers at his friend.

RANDAL
What did he say?

DANTE
He said it was important to have
standards. He said nobody has pride
anymore.

RANDAL
It's not like you laid the eggs
yourself.

DANTE
I'll give him five more minutes then
I'm calling the cops. I don't need
this, man. I'm not even supposed to
be here today.

A SMOKER steps in.

SMOKER
Two packs of cigarettes.

Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and
searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and
then at the O.C. oddity.

The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER looks
at RANDAL.

RANDAL
(Still staring at the
ODD MAN)
I'm as puzzled as you.

SMOKER
(paying DANTE)
I've actually seen it before.

DANTE
You know him?

SMOKER
No, I've seen that behavior before.
Looking for the perfect carton of
eggs, right?

RANDAL
(a bit astonished)
Yeah. How'd you know?

SMOKER
I'll bet you a million bucks that
the guy's a guidance counselor.

DANTE
Why do you say that?

SMOKER
I was in the Food City last year
when the same thing happened,
different guy though. Stock boy told
me that the guy had been looking
through the eggs for like half an
hour, doing all sorts of endurance
tests and shit. I ask the kid how
come nobody called the manager, and
he says it happens twice a week,
sometimes more.

RANDAL
Get out of here.

SMOKER
I kid you not. They call it Shell
Shock. Only happens with guidance
counselors for some reason. The kid
said they used to make a big deal
about it, but there's no point.

The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.
He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
still sitting on the floor.

SMOKER (O.S.)
He said they always pay for whatever
they break and they never bother
anybody.

DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

DANTE
Why guidance counselors?

SMOKER
If your job served as little purpose
as theirs, wouldn't you lose it,
too?

RANDAL
Come to think of it, my guidance
counselor was kind of worthless.

SMOKER

See? It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.  That's

And then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding
money. She can't be any more than five.

LITTLE GIRL
(innocently)

RANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the
transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth.

RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as
the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun.

DANTE
Did you ever notice all the prices

RANDAL
You know how much money the average
jizz-mopper make per hour?

DANTE
What's a jizz-mopper?

He's the guy in those nudie-booth

DANTE
Nudie booth?

RANDAL
Nudie booth. You've never been in a
nudie booth?

DANTE
I guess not.

A female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings
her up.

RANDAL
Oh, it's great. You step into this
little booth and there's this window
between you and this naked woman,
and she puts on this little show for
like ten bucks.

DANTE
What kind of show?

RANDAL
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.  These
chicks do it all. They insert things
into any opening in their body...
any opening.
(to customer)
He's led a very sheltered life.

DANTE
(indicating CUSTOMER)
Can we talk about this later?

RANDAL
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up
the booths afterward, because
practically everybody shoots a load
against the window, and I don't know
if you know or not, but cum leaves
streaks if you don't clean it right
away.

CUSTOMER
(grabbing her bag,
disgusted)
This is the last time I come to this
place.

DANTE
Excuse me?

CUSTOMER
Using filthy language in front of
the customers... you should both get
fired.

DANTE
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little
carried away.

CUSTOMER
Well, I don't know if sorry can make
up for it. I found your remarks highly
offensive.

The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something.

RANDAL
Well, you think that's offensive...

RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic picture
of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open.

RANDAL
...then check this out. I think you
can see her kidneys.

RANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically
apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER.

DANTE
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please,
wait a second, ma'am...

The CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter.
DANTE turns on RANDAL.

DANTE
Why do you do things like that? You
know she's going to come back and
tell the boss.

RANDAL
Who cares? That lady's an asshole.
Everybody that comes in here is way
too uptight. This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking
customers.

DANTE
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.

RANDAL
You gotta loosen up, my friend.
You'd feel a hell of a lot better if
you'd rip into the occasional
customer.

DANTE
What for? They don't bother me if I
don't bother them.

RANDAL
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers
that annoy the piss out of you on a
daily basis.

DANTE
There aren't.

RANDAL
How can you lie like that? Why don't
you vent? Vent your frustration.
Come on, who pisses you off?

DANTE
(reluctantly)
It's not really anyone per se, it's
more of separate groupings.

RANDAL
Let's hear it.

DANTE
(pause)
The milkmaids.

RANDAL
The milkmaids?

INSERT: MILK HANDLER

A WOMAN pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the
cooler for that perfect container of milk.

DANTE (O.S.)
The women that go through every gallon
of milk looking for a later date. As
if somewhere-beyond all the other
gallons-is a container of milk that
won't go bad for like a decade.

END INSERT

RANDAL
You know who I can do without? I
could do without the people in the
video store.

DANTE
Which ones?

RANDAL
All of them.

MONTAGE INSERT #1/VIDEO JERKS

A series of people addressing the camera, asking the dumb
questions.

FIRST
What would you get for a six-year-
old boy who chronically wets his
bed?

SECOND
(in front of stocked
new release shelf)
Do you have any new movies in?

THIRD
Do you have that one with the guy
who was in that movie that was out
last year?

END INSERT

RANDAL
And they never rent quality flicks;
they always pick the most
intellectually devoid movie on the
rack.

MONTAGE INSERT #2/"Ooooh!..."

An identical series of customers finding their ideal choices.

FIRST
Ooooh! Home Alone!

SECOND
Ooooh! Hook!

THIRD
Ooooh! Navy Seals!

END INSERT

RANDAL
It's like in order to join, they
have to have an IQ less than their
shoe size.

DANTE
You think you get stupid questions?
You should hear the barrage of stupid
questions I get.

MONTAGE INSERT #3/DUMB QUESTIONS

A series of people standing in various locations throughout
the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions.

FIRST
(holding coffee)
What do you mean there's no ice?
You mean I've gotta drink this coffee
hot?!

SECOND
(holding up item from
clearly marked $.99
display)
How much?

THIRD
(peeking in door)
Do you sell hubcaps?

END INSERT

RANDAL
See? You vented. Don't you feel better
now?

DANTE
No.

RANDAL
Why not?

DANTE
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting
married.

RANDAL
Jesus, you got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin,
Caitlin...

DANTE
(jerking head toward
door)
Veronica!

DANTE gives RANDAL a shove to shut him up. VERONICA enters
the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum
foil.

VERONICA
What happened to home by twelve?

DANTE is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under
her arm.

DANTE
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't
you in class?

VERONICA
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped
home and brought you some lunch.

DANTE
What is it?

VERONICA
Peanut butter and jelly with the
crusts cut off. What do you think it
is? It's lasagne.

DANTE
Really?
(kisses her forehead)
You're the best.

VERONICA
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.
(to RANDAL)
Hi, Randal.

RANDAL (O.S.)
(exaggeratively
impressed)
Thirty-seven!

DANTE
(to O.C.)
Shut up!
(to VERONICA)
Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not
happy about it, but I've been able
to deal.

RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C.

DANTE
(to O.C.)
Why don't you go back to the video
store?

RANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He
exits.

VERONICA
You had to tell him.

DANTE
I had to tell someone. He put it
into perspective.

VERONICA
What did he say?

DANTE
At least he wasn't thirty-six.

VERONICA
And that made you feel better?

DANTE
And he said most of them are college
guys, I've never met or seen.

VERONICA
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't
see it...

DANTE
...it isn't there. Yes.

VERONICA
Thank you for being rational.

DANTE
Thank you for the lasagne.

VERONICA
You couldn't get these shutters open?

DANTE
I called a locksmith and he said the
earliest he could get here it
tomorrow.

VERONICA
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back
for the one-thirty class.

DANTE
What time do you get finished?

VERONICA
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting
till nine, so I'll be back before
you close. Can we go out and get
some coffee?

DANTE
Sure.

VERONICA
Good.
(kisses him)
I'll see you when you close, then.
Enjoy the lasagne.

She exits. DANTE leans against the magazine rack with his
lasagne, contemplative. RANDAL pops his head in and makes
the loud slurping noise again.

CUT TO:

INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL is recommending titles to potential customers.

RANDAL
All right, now if you're really
feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey
and the Bandit Three is the movie
you must rent.

CUSTOMER
(studying box)
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds
in it.

RANDAL
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a
great movie, right?

DANTE opens the door and leans in.

DANTE
Can you come next door? I gotta make
a phone call.

RANDAL
(to DANTE)
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?

DANTE
The best Burtless movie ever made.

DANTE exits. RANDAL gives his customers the what-did-I-tell-
you look.

THE CAT lies on the counter. Pull back to reveal RANDAL as
he rings up an order. The CUSTOMER pets the cat, smiling.

CUSTOMER
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?

RANDAL
Lenin's Tomb.

Dolly over to DANTE, on the phone.

DANTE
Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is
Dante... Did he say if he was on his
way here?... Here... The convenience
store... I know, but the other guy
called out this morning and Mr.
Synder asked me to cover until he
got here. He said he'd be here by
noon, but it's one-thirty now, so
I... Excuse me... Vermont?!... No,
that can't be; I talked to him this
morning... He left at what time?...
He really went to Vermont?... When
the hell was someone going to tell
me?... He promised he was coming by
noon!... Jesus... When does he get
back?!... TUESDAY!... You've gotta
be fucking kidding me!... I've got a
hockey game at two, and the fucking
shutters are jammed closed, and he's
in Vermont?... I'm not even supposed
to be here today!!
(deep sigh)
So I'm stuck here till closing?...
This is just great... I just can't
believe... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to yell at you... No... No, I'll be
all right... Well, that's all I can
do, right?... Thanks.

He hangs up. RANDAL joins him.

RANDAL
Vermont?

DANTE
Can you believe this?!

RANDAL
He didn't mention it when he called
you this morning?

DANTE
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!

RANDAL
So, what-you're stuck here all day?

DANTE
FUCK!

RANDAL
Why'd you apologize?

DANTE
What?

RANDAL
I heard you apologize. Why? You have
every right in the world to be mad.

DANTE
I know.

RANDAL
That seems to be the leitmotif in
your life; ever backing down.

DANTE
I don't back down.

RANDAL
Yes, you do. You always back down.
You assume blame that isn't yours,
you come in when called as opposed
to enjoying your day off, you buckle
like a belt.

DANTE
You know what pisses me off the most?

RANDAL
The fact that I'm right about your
buckling?

DANTE
I'm going to miss the game.

RANDAL
Because you buckled.

DANTE
Would you shut the hell up with that
shit? It's not helping.

RANDAL
Don't yell at me, pal.

DANTE
Sorry.

RANDAL
See? There you go again.

DANTE
I can't believe I'm going to miss
the game!

RANDAL
At least we're stuck here together.

DANTE
You've got a customer.

RANDAL walks away.

RANDAL (O.S.)
What? What do you want?!

DANTE shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone
again.

DANTE
Sanford?  Dante... I can't play
today... I'm stuck at work... I know
I'm not scheduled, but-just forget
it. I can't play... Neither can
Randal... He's working too...

RANDAL comes back. DANTE rolls his eyes to the ceiling.

DANTE
(getting an idea)
Wait a second. Do we have to play at
the park?... Hold on...
(to RANDAL)
Do you feel limber?

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

TAPE is rolled around the top of a stick. Laces are pulled
tightly. An orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade.
The HOCKEY PLAYERS fill the convenience store. Some sit on
the floor or lean against the coolers, but all are either
preparing or practicing. RANDAL enters, wearing his equipment.

DANTE skates to his side.

DANTE
(lifting his foot)
Pull my laces tighter.

RANDAL
(drops mitt and pulls
laces)
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this
is one of the ballsiest moves I've
ever been privy to. I never would
have thought you capable of such
blatant disregard of store policy.

DANTE
I told him I had a game today. It's
his own fault.

RANDAL
No argument here. Insubordination
rules.

DANTE
I just want to play hockey like I
was scheduled to.

SANFORD skates up and skids to a halt.

SANFORD
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.

DANTE
If you grab a Gatorade, then
everybody's going to grab one.

SANFORD
So?

DANTE
So? So nobody's going to want to pay
for these Gatorades.

SANFORD
What do you care? Hey, what smells
like shoe polish?

DANTE
I've got a responsibility here. I
can't let everybody grab free drinks.

SANFORD
What responsibility? You're closing
the fucking store to play hockey.

RANDAL
He's blunt, but he's got a point.

DANTE
At least let me maintain some
semblance of managerial control here.

SANFORD
All I'm saying is if you're going to
be insubordinate, you should go the
full nine and not pussy out when it
comes to free refreshments.

RANDAL
He's right. As if we're suddenly
gonna have a run on Gatorade.

SANFORD
Fuckin-A.

DANTE
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are
pushy.

SANFORD
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

RANDAL
Design major.

DANTE
Can we not talk about this?

SANFORD
Fine by me. But you're living in
denial and suppressing rage.
(skating away; to all)
Dante said we can all drink free
Gatorade.

A laid-back hurrah is heard.

RANDAL
Are you gonna lock the store?

DANTE
I don't know. You going to lock the
video store?

RANDAL
Look who you're asking here. How're
we gonna block off the street?

DANTE
We're not playing in the street.

RANDAL
Then where're we gonna play?

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

THE SIGN ON THE DOOR READS: TEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER
FIRST PERIOD.

The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by
one.  ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around.
More players join them.

From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a
store with many men gliding around on the roof.

On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.

REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls
his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD skates
in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and SILENT BOB
deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge and JAY throws
up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the center of the court.

DANTE
Ready?

PLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and holds
the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off, and
the ball is in play.

The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.

Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots
are taken, CU's of various players included.

INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting
scored on and more face-offs.

Below, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He
reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting
to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

Below, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
he watches for a moment before calling out.

CUSTOMER
When's this period over?

SOMEONE (O.S.)
Eight more minutes!

CUSTOMER
Are you shitting me? I want to get
cigarettes!

DANTE skids to the sidelines.

DANTE
(out of breath)
If you can just wait a few more
minutes.

CUSTOMER
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy
neck on this ladder!

SOMEONE (O.S.)
Dante! Where are you?!

CUSTOMER
He's busy!

DANTE starts to skate away.

DANTE
I'll be right back. It's almost over.

He jumps back into the game.

CUSTOMER
What the fuck is this?! I want some
service!

DANTE (O.S.)
In a second!

CUSTOMER
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at
you! You can't even pass!

DANTE (O.S.)
I can pass!

CUSTOMER
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

DANTE
Who are you to make assessments?

CUSTOMER
I'll assess all I want!

SOMEONE (O.S.)
DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!

CUSTOMER
(to O.C. SOMEONE)
Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!
(to DANTE)
You suck!

DANTE
Like you're better!

CUSTOMER
I can whip your ass.

Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,
face against the glass.

DANTE (O.S.)
That's easy to say from over here.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
knock your fucking teeth out and
pass all over your ass.

The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the
roof.

WOMAN
Is the convenience store open?

Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

DANTE AND CUSTOMER
(simultaneously)
NO!

DANTE
(to CUSTOMER)
There's a stick over there. You're
shooting against the goal.
(to the court)
REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
ON!

A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the court,
through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls to the
sidelines.

DANTE
Give me another ball.

SOMEONE (O.S.)
There are no more.

DANTE
What the fuck are you talking about?
How many balls did you bring?

SANFORD skates up to him.

SANFORD
(counting)
There was the orange ball... and the
orange ball.

DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

DANTE
Are there any balls down there?!

JAY (O.S.)
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen!
NYNNE!!

DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

DANTE
You only brought one ball?!

SANFORD
I thought Redding had like three
balls!

REDDING (O.S.)
I thought Dante had the balls.

DANTE
Nobody has another ball?

SANFORD
Shit!

DANTE
We get... what... twelve minutes of
game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!!
(pause; rubs head)
I'm not even supposed to be here
today!

DANTE skates off.

SANFORD
We still get free Gatorade, right?

DANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An
OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder.

OLD MAN
Be careful.

DANTE
I'm trying.

OLD MAN
You know the insides of those are
filled with stuff that gives you
cancer.

DANTE
So I'm told.

OLD MAN
I had a friend that used to chew
glass for a living. In the circus.

The light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it.

DANTE
And he got cancer by chewing
fluorescent bulb glass...?

OLD MAN
No, he got hit by a bus.

DANTE
(confused)
Oh... Can I help you?

OLD MAN
Well, that depends. Do you have a
bathroom?

DANTE
Um... yeah, but it's for employees
only.

OLD MAN
I understand, but can I use it. I'm
not that young anymore, so I'm kind
of... you know... incontinent.

DANTE
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back
through the cooler.

OLD MAN
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet
paper you got back there?

DANTE
The white kind.

OLD MAN
I'm not asking about the color. I
mean is it rough or cottony?

DANTE
Actually, it is kind of rough.

OLD MAN
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell
out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would
you mind if I took a roll of the
soft stuff back there. I see you
sell the soft stuff.

DANTE
Yeah, but...

OLD MAN
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference?
You said yourself the stuff that's
there now is rough.

DANTE
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

OLD MAN
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

The OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The
OLD MAN returns.

OLD MAN
Say, young fella, you know I hate to
bother you again, but can I take a
paper or something back there... to
read?  It usually takes me a while,
and I like to read while it's going
on.

DANTE
Jesus... go ahead.

OLD MAN
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart
of gold.

The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines.
He comes back to the counter.

DANTE
You know, you probably could've been
home, already, in the time it's taken
you to get in there.

OLD MAN
Can I trouble you for one of those
magazines?

DANTE
I said go ahead.

OLD MAN
No, I mean the ones there. Behind
the counter.

DANTE glances over and reacts.

DANTE
The porno mags?

OLD MAN
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make
me laugh. They draw the biggest
titties.

DANTE
(hands one to him)
Here. Now leave me alone.

OLD MAN
Uh, can I have the other one. The
one below this one. They show more
in that one.

DANTE makes the switch.

OLD MAN
Thanks son. I appreciate this.

The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close,
then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE.

RANDAL
Helluva game!

DANTE
One ball!! They come all the way
here... I close the damn store...
for one ball!

RANDAL
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to
play.

DANTE
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game!
Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!

RANDAL
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want
something to drink?
(walking away)

DANTE
Gatorade.

Pause. Then...

RANDAL (O.S.)
What happened to all the Gatorade?

DANTE
Exactly. They drank it all.

RANDAL (O.S.)
After an exhausting game like that I
can believe it.

DANTE
(as RANDAL)
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."

RANDAL comes back with drinks.

RANDAL
You know what Sanford told me?
(offering drink)

DANTE
I still can't believe Caitlin's
getting married.

RANDAL
Julie Dwyer died.

DANTE
Yeah, right.

RANDAL
No, I'm serious.

DANTE is visibly taken aback.

DANTE
Oh, my god.

RANDAL
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

DANTE
How? When?

RANDAL
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

DANTE
Jesus.

RANDAL
She was swimming at the YMCA pool
when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.

DANTE
I haven't seen her in almost two
years.

RANDAL
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
she one of the illustrious twelve?

DANTE
Number six.

RANDAL
You've had sex with a dead person.

DANTE
I'm gonna go to her wake.

RANDAL
No, you're not.

DANTE
Why not?

RANDAL
It's today.

DANTE
What!?

RANDAL
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next
show is at four.

DANTE
Shit. What about tomorrow?

RANDAL
One night only. She's buried in the
morning.

DANTE
You've gotta watch the store. I have
to go to this.

RANDAL
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to
you that I might bereaved as well?

DANTE
You hardly knew her!

RANDAL
True, but do you know how many people
are going to be there? All of our
old classmates, to say the least.

DANTE
Stop it. This is beneath even you.

RANDAL
I'm not missing what's probably going
to be the social event of the season.

DANTE
You hate people.

RANDAL
But I love gatherings. Isn't it
ironic?

DANTE
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to
stay with the store.

RANDAL
If you go, I go.

DANTE
She meant nothing to you!

RANDAL
She meant nothing to you either until
I told you she died.

DANTE
I'm not taking you to this funeral.

RANDAL
I'm going with you.

DANTE
I can't close the store.

RANDAL
You just closed the store to play
hockey on the roof!

DANTE
Exactly, which means I can't close
it for another hour so we can both
go to a wake.

Silence. Then...

RANDAL
She was pretty young, hunhh?

DANTE
Twenty-two; same as us.

RANDAL
An embolism in a pool.

DANTE
An embarrassing way to die.

RANDAL
That's nothing compared to how my
cousin Walter died.

DANTE
How'd he die?

RANDAL
Broke his neck.

DANTE
That's embarrassing?

RANDAL
He broke his neck trying to suck his
own dick.

Absolute silence. Then...

DANTE
Shut the hell up.

RANDAL
Bible truth.

DANTE
Stop it.

RANDAL
I swear.

DANTE
Oh, my god.

RANDAL
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to
suck your own dick?

DANTE
No!

RANDAL
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.

DANTE
Because I never tried to suck my own
dick?

RANDAL
No, because you won't admit to it.
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
because he tries to go down on
himself. You're as curious as the
rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

DANTE
Who found him?

RANDAL
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his
bed, doubled over himself with his
legs on top. Dick in his mouth.
My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

DANTE
His dick was in his mouth?

RANDAL
Balls resting on his lips.

DANTE
He made it, hunhh?

RANDAL
Yeah, but at what a price.

Silence. Then...

DANTE
I could never reach.

RANDAL
Reach what?

DANTE
You know.

RANDAL
What, your dick?

DANTE
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I
guess everyone tries it, sooner of
later.

RANDAL
I never tried it.

DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...

RANDAL
Fucking pervert.

DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor.

DANTE
I know it was a bad idea to close
the store.

RANDAL
Listen to you.

DANTE
I can't help it. At least when we
were playing hockey outside, I could
see if anyone wanted to go in.

Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on

come to the store at four on a
Saturday?

DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by
a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.
The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the middle
of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely
nobody is outside.

DANTE
(furious)
I can't fucking believe you!!

RANDAL
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

DANTE
You knocked the fucking casket over,
for Chrissakes!

RANDAL
I was just leaning on it! It was an
accident!

DANTE
Does anyone ever knock over a casket
on purpose?

RANDAL
So the casket fell over! Big deal!

DANTE
Her fucking body fell out!

RANDAL
So they'll put her back in! It's not
like it's gonna matter if she breaks
something!

DANTE
(opening door)
Just... go! Go open the video store.

JAY (O.S.)
(mimicking)
Yeah! Open the video store!!

RANDAL
(to O.C.)
Shut the fuck up, junkie!

JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt
at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

DANTE
(to RANDAL)
Go open the video store.

JAY
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

DANTE
(to JAY)
How many times I gotta tell you not
to deal outside the store.

JAY
I'm not dealing.

A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

KID
You got anything, man?

JAY
Yeah, what do you want?

RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience
store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears, flashlight
in hand, scanning the ground.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER

Hey, did you see a set of keys lying
around here somewhere?

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

RANDAL
Let me borrow your car.

DANTE
I don't want to talk to you.

RANDAL
Fine. Just lend me your car.

DANTE
Why should I loan you my car?

RANDAL
I want to rent a movie.

DANTE
(pause)
You want to rent a movie.

DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

RANDAL
What's that for?

DANTE
You work in a video store!

They head back to the counter.

RANDAL
I work in a shitty video store. I
want to go to a good video store so
I can rent a good movie.

CUSTOMER
Are you open?

DANTE AND RANDAL
(simultaneously)
YES!

The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes.
(pets cat)
Cute cat. What's its name?

RANDAL
Annoying Customer.

The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.
DANTE puts up cigarettes.

DANTE
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers at least some of
the time?

RANDAL
Let me borrow your car.

DANTE
(calmer)
May I be blunt with you?

RANDAL
If you must.

DANTE
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST video,
respectively. As such, we have
certain responsibilities which-though
it may seem cruel and unusual-does
include manning our posts until
closing.

RANDAL
I see. So playing hockey and attending
wakes-these practices are standard
operating procedure.

DANTE
There's a difference. Those were
obligations. Obligations that could
not have been met at any later date.
Now renting videos-that's just
gratuitous, not to mention illogical,
considering you work in a video store.

Another CUSTOMER leans in.

CUSTOMER
Are you open?

DANTE
(rolls his eyes)
Yes.

RANDAL
You know what? I don't think I care
for your rationale.

DANTE
It's going to have to do for now,
considering that it's my car that's
up for request.
(to CUSTOMER)
Can I help you?

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes.

RANDAL
What's your point?

DANTE
My point is that you're a clerk,
paid to do a job. You can't just do
anything you want while you're
working.

CUSTOMER
(reading tabloid)
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of
Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."
(to DANTE and RANDAL)
They print any kind of shit in these
papers.

DANTE
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

RANDAL
So your argument is that title
dictates behavior?

DANTE
What?

RANDAL
The reasons you won't let me borrow
your car is because I have a title
and a job description, and I'm
supposed to follow it, right?

DANTE
Exactly.

CUSTOMER
(interjecting)
I saw one, one time, that said the
world was ending the next week.
Then in the next week's paper, they
said we were miraculously saved at
the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant
bird. Crazy shit.

RANDAL
(eyes the CUSTOMER,
annoyed)
So I'm no more responsible for my
own decisions while I'm here at work
than, say, the Death Squad soldiers
in Bosnia?

DANTE
That's stretching it. You're not
being asked to slay children or
anything.

RANDAL
Not yet.
(sips water)

CUSTOMER
(again with the
interjections)
And I remember this one time the
damn paper said...

RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from
over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.

DANTE plays block.

CUSTOMER
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

DANTE
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
it! He was trying to get me.

CUSTOMER
Well, he missed!

DANTE
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
your cigarette money, and we'll call
it even.

CUSTOMER
(considerably calmer;
takes money)
This is the last time I ever come
here.
(to RANDAL)
And if I ever see you again, I'm
gonna break your fucking head open!

The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL
salutes him.

DANTE
(angrily)
What the fuck did you do that for?

RANDAL
Two reasons: one, I hate when the
people can't shut up about the stupid
tabloid headlines.

DANTE
Jesus!

RANDAL
And two, to make a point: title does
not dictate behavior.

DANTE
What?

RANDAL
If title dictated my behavior, as a
clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
be allowed to spit a mouthful of
water at that guy. But I did, so my
point is that people dictate their
own behavior. Hence, even though I'm
a clerk in this video store, I choose
to go rent videos at Big Choice.
(extends opened palm)
Agreed?

DANTE
(shakes his head;
hands over keys)
You're a danger to both the dead and
the living.

RANDAL
I like to think I'm a master of my
own destiny.

DANTE
Please, get the hell out of here.

RANDAL
I know I'm your hero.

RANDAL exits.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of
milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

TRAINER
Sounds to me like somebody needs to
hit the gym.

DANTE
Excuse me?

TRAINER
I heard you strain when you put the
milk in the bag. That milk only weighs
about seven pounds.

DANTE
I didn't strain. I sighed.

TRAINER
I don't think so. That was a grunt;
a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
trainer. I know what that sound
signifies: you're out of shape.

DANTE
I don't think so.

TRAINER
Oh, I do. You made the same noise
when you reached across the counter
for my cash. Your muscles are thin
and sadly underutilized.

DANTE
They are not.

TRAINER
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

DANTE
What are you talking about? There's
no fat on this body.

TRAINER
No fat, but no tone either. You don't
get enough exercise.

A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

HEATHER
Are you open?

DANTE
Yes.

HEATHER
(grabs a paper)
Just the paper.

DANTE
(to HEATHER)
Thirty-fire.

TRAINER
(to HEATHER)
Let me ask you a question: Do you
think this guy's out of shape?

HEATHER
(studies DANTE)
I don't know. I can't really tell
from here.

TRAINER
He is.

DANTE
I am not.

TRAINER
How much can you bench?

DANTE
I don't know.

HEATHER
(studying DANTE)
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

DANTE
I know I can bench more than that!

TRAINER
I think the lady called it.

HEATHER
My ex-boyfriend was about his height,
but he was much bulkier. He could
bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.

TRAINER
I do about three-fifty, four.

HEATHER
No way!

TRAINER
(rolling up sleeve)
Feel that.

HEATHER
That's tight. Solid.

TRAINER
Now feel his.
(to DANTE)
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

DANTE
Oh for God's sake!

TRAINER
See? You're ashamed. You know you're
out of shape. Take my card.  I can
help you tone that body up in no
time. Get you on an aerobics and
free-weights program.

A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter.

SUITED MAN
You open?

DANTE
(to MAN)
Yes.
(to TRAINER)
I'm not out of shape.

SUITED MAN
Excuse me, but have you been here
all day?

DANTE
What?

HEATHER
(still studying DANTE)
He's got those love handles.

DANTE
(to HEATHER)
I don't have love handles.

SUITED MAN
Were you working here at about four
o'clock?

DANTE
I've been here since six o'clock
this morning. Why?

TRAINER
(to HEATHER)
It's probably from being around all
this food every day.

HEATHER
Oh, I know. If I had to work here
all day, I'd be bloated and out of
shape, too.

DANTE
I'm not out of shape!

SUITED MAN
Can I have your name please?

DANTE
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

HEATHER
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
didn't even recognize you!

TRAINER
Because he's out of shape.

DANTE
Do I know you?

HEATHER
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
out with...

DANTE
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

HEATHER
I'm her sister.

DANTE
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?

HEATHER
Yep. I remember you got caught in my
parents' room with Caitlin once.

TRAINER
Did you say Caitlin Bree?

DANTE
Yeah.

TRAINER
Pretty girl, about this girl's height-
dark hair-gorgeous body?

DANTE
Yeah?

TRAINER
And your name is Dante Hicks? You
went to high school with her? You
played hockey?

DANTE
How do you know that?

TRAINER
Oh man! Hey, you still going out
with her?

DANTE
No, she's getting married.

TRAINER
To you?

HEATHER
To an Asian design major.

TRAINER
Shit!
(to DANTE)
Don't take this the wrong way, but I
used to fuck her.

DANTE
What?

TRAINER
While you two were dating in high
school. We're talking four, five
years ago, back when I drove a Trans-
Am.

HEATHER
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

TRAINER
Yeah!

DANTE
You know him?

HEATHER
Caitlin used to talk about him all
the time.

TRAINER
Really?

HEATHER
Oh yeah. You were the built older
guy with the black Trans and the
big...

DANTE
Wait a second!
(to TRAINER)
You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
While I was dating her?

TRAINER
All the time. That girl was like a
rabbit.

DANTE
I... I don't believe this...

HEATHER
(to TRAINER)
I still remember Caitlin telling us
about that time you two went to that
motel-the one with the mirrors and
the hot tub in the room.

DANTE
THE GLADES MOTEL?

TRAINER
Holy shit! She told you about that!
(to DANTE)
Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
watched the whole thing. They used
to film people at that hotel; nobody
knew about it.

HEATHER
She said one time you set up a tent
on the beach and you guys did it in
the middle of this big rainstorm.

DANTE
What? When? When did all this shit
happen?

TRAINER
Hey man, that was a long time ago.
Don't let it get to you.

HEATHER
I'm surprised you never found out
about it, Dante. Everybody in school
knew-even in my class.

DANTE
Jesus Christ, what next?

The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and
hands it to DANTE.

SUITED MAN
Here you go.

DANTE
What's this?

SUITED MAN
A fine, for five hundred dollars.

DANTE
WHAT?

TRAINER
Five hundred bucks? What for?

SUITED MAN
For violation of New Jersey Statute
Section Two A, number one-seventy
slash fifty-one: Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco or tobacco-
related products to persons under
the age of eighteen is regarded as
disorderly.

DANTE
What are you talking about?

SUITED MAN
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey
Administrative Code, section eighteen,
five, slash twelve point five-a fine
of no less than two hundred and fifty
dollars is to be leveled against any
person reported selling cigarettes
to a minor.

DANTE
I didn't do that!

SUITED MAN
You said you were here all day?

DANTE
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
to any kids!

SUITED MAN
An angry mother called the state
division of taxation and complained
that the man working at Quick Stop
Convenience sold her five-year-old
daughter cigarettes today at around
four o'clock. Division of taxation
calls the State Board of Health, and
they send me down here to issue a
fine. You say you were working all
day, hence the fine is yours.  It's
doubled due to the incredibly young
age of the child.

DANTE
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
kid!

TRAINER
To a five-year-old kid? What a
scumbag!

HEATHER
That's sick, Dante.

DANTE
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I swear!

SUITED MAN
The due date is on the bottom. This
summons cannot be contested in any
court of law. Failure to remit before
the due date will result in a charge
of criminal negligence, and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest. Have
a nice day.

The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

DANTE
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
kids! Hey!

TRAINER
(takes back the card)
Forget it. I don't want to deal with
a guy that sells cigarettes to a
five-year-old.
(to HEATHER)
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

HEATHER
Sure. How about the beach?

TRAINER
I like the way you think.

The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his
forehead.

DANTE
Jesus! What next?

VOICE (O.S.)
Dante?

DANTE spins, angrily.

DANTE
What?

His expression softens.

DANTE
Caitlin?

CUT TO:

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

JAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on.

JAY
That's the price, my brother.

JOHN
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.

JAY
For this kind of hash, you need that
kind of cash.

JOHN
How long you gonna be here?

JAY
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's
party.

JOHN
You're gonna be at John K's party?

JAY
(to SILENT BOB)
My man is deaf.
(yelling)
I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!
(quieter)
Neh.

JOHN
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm
gonna get the cash and buy it from
you at John K's. You're gonna bring
it, right?

JAY
The only place I don't bring my drugs
is church. And that ain't till Sunday
morning.

JOHN
Yo. I'll see you at that party.
(puts his hand up to
be slapped)
I'll see you there?

JAY
(reluctantly slapping
hands)
I'll see you there.

JOHN leaves. JAY turns to SILENT BOB.

JAY
It's motherfuckers like that who
give recreational drug users a bag
name.

someone O.C.)
HEY BABY!  YOU EVER HAD YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED?

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE and CAITLIN are embracing very tightly. We hold on
them for a few seconds, just to let it sink in. Then...

DANTE
When did you get back?

CAITLIN
Just now.

DANTE
My God. I haven't seen you since...
(he hugs her again)

CAITLIN
Dante. You've got a customer.

DANTE hops behind the counter. A customer pays for something
while DANTE continues to talk.

CAITLIN
I just saw Alyssa's little sister
outside. She was with Rick Derris.

DANTE
Let's not talk about that. How'd you
get home?

CAITLIN
Train. It took eight hours.

DANTE
I can't believe you're here.

Another customer comes to the counter.

CUSTOMER
Excuse me, do you have...

DANTE
(to CUSTOMER)
To the back, above the oil.
(to CAITLIN)
How long are you staying?

CAITLIN
Until Monday. Then I have to take
the train back.

Yet another customer comes to the counter.

CUSTOMER
Pack of cigarettes.
(to CAITLIN)
Congratulations. I saw that
announcement in today's paper.
(to DANTE)
She's marrying an Asian design major.

DANTE
So I'm told.

CUT TO:

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

JAY and SILENT BOB lean against the wall.

JAY
Man, it's fucking slow.

SILENT BOB walks out of the frame, leaving JAY alone against
the wall. He comes back a few seconds later, carrying a mini-
Walkman with ten-watt speakers. He sets it down on the ground
and turns it on. House music starts playing. Jay-possessed
by the beat-breaks into an impromptu dance, in which he makes
suggestive and often lewd moves. SILENT BOB leans against
the wall.

CUT TO:

INT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

On counter.

CAITLIN
You're just going to lock the store
like that?

DANTE
I want to talk to you about something,
and I don't want to be disturbed.

CAITLIN
You saw it?

DANTE
Very dramatic, I thought.

CAITLIN
It's not what you think.

DANTE
What, it's worse? You're pregnant
with an Asian design major's child?

CAITLIN
I'm not pregnant.

DANTE
Were you going to tell me or just
send me an invitation?

CAITLIN
I was going to tell you. But then we
were getting along so well, I didn't
want to mess it up.

DANTE
You could've broke it to me gently,
you know; at least started by telling
me you had a boyfriend. I told you I
have a girlfriend.

CAITLIN
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started
talking... it's like I forgot I had
a boyfriend. And then he proposed
last month...

DANTE
And you said yes?

CAITLIN
Well... kind of, sort of?

DANTE
Is that what they teach you at that
school of yours? Kind of, sort of?
Everyone knows about this except me!
Do you know how humiliating that is?

CAITLIN
I would've told you, and you would
have stopped calling, like a baby.

DANTE
How do you know that?

CAITLIN
Because I know you. You prefer drastic
measures to rational ones.

DANTE
So you're really getting married?

CAITLIN
No.

DANTE
No, you're not really getting married?

CAITLIN
The story goes like this: He proposed,
and I told him I had to think about
it, and he insisted I wear the ring
anyway. Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

DANTE
How like her.

CAITLIN
Then my mother called me this morning
and told me the announcement was in
the paper. That's when I hopped the
train to come back here, because I
knew you'd be a wreck.

DANTE
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

CAITLIN
Was I right?

DANTE
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is
more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

CAITLIN
I love a macho façade. It's such a
turn-on.
(sniffing air)
What smells like shoe polish?

DANTE
And you came here to what? To comfort
me?

CAITLIN
The last thing I needed was for you
to think I was hiding something from
you.

DANTE
But you were.

CAITLIN
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
you'd I'd been seeing other people.

DANTE
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
you're ready to walk down the aisle-
I'd say that constitutes something
more than just seeing somebody.

CAITLIN
I'm giving him his ring back.

DANTE
What?

CAITLIN
I don't want to marry him. I don't
want to get married now. I'm on the
verge of graduation. I want to go to
grad school after this. And then I
want to start a career. I don't want
to be a wife first, and then have to
worry about when I'm going to fit in
all of the other stuff.  I've come
way too far and studied too hard to
let my education go to waste as a
housewife. And I know that's what
I'd become. Sang's already signed
with a major firm, and he's going to
be pulling a huge salary, which would
give me no reason to work, and he's
so traditional anyway...

DANTE
Sang? His name is a past tense?

CAITLIN
Stop it. He's a nice guy.

DANTE
If he's so nice, why aren't you going
to marry him?

CAITLIN
I just told you.

DANTE
There's more, isn't there?

CAITLIN
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

DANTE
Tell me I don't have something to do
with it.

CAITLIN
You don't have anything to do with
it.

DANTE
You lie.

CAITLIN
Look how full of yourself you are.

DANTE
I just believe in giving credit where
credit is due. And I believe that
I'm the impetus behind your failure
to wed.

CAITLIN
If I'm so nuts about you, then why
am I having sex with an Asian design
major?

DANTE
Jesus, you're caustic.

CAITLIN
I had to bring you down from that
cloud you were floating on. When I
say I don't want to get married, I
mean just that. I don't want to marry
anybody. Not for years.

DANTE
So who's asking? I don't want to
marry you.

CAITLIN
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

DANTE
But can we date?

CAITLIN
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would
like that.

DANTE
We could introduce them. They might
hit it off.

CAITLIN
You're serious. You want to date
again.

DANTE
I would like to be your boyfriend,
yes.

CAITLIN
It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years. Believe me, you'll
get over it.

DANTE
Give me a bit more credit. I think
it's time we got back together, you
know. I'm more mature, you're more
mature, you're finishing college,
I'm already in the job market...

CAITLIN
You work in a market, all right.

DANTE
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
go out again. After all the talking
we've been doing.

CAITLIN
The key word here is talk, Dante. I
think the idea, the conception of us
dating is more idyllic than what
actually happens when we date.

DANTE
So... what? So we should just make
pretend over the phone that we're
dating?

CAITLIN
I don't know. Maybe we should just
see what happens.

DANTE
Let me take you out tonight.

CAITLIN
You mean, on a date?

DANTE
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

CAITLIN
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
Date. I think I've been on that one
before.

DANTE
You have a better suggestion?

CAITLIN
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
Somewhere Kind of Private Date?

DANTE
I hear that's a rather popular date.

CAITLIN
(hits him)
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
you, succumbing to your wily charms,
and you call me a slut, in so many
words.

DANTE
What about Sing?

CAITLIN
Sang.

DANTE
Sang.

CAITLIN
He's not invited.

DANTE
He's your fiancé.

CAITLIN
I offer you my body and you offer me
semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
Dante, and in case you haven't gotten
the drift of why I came all the way
here from Ohio, I'm about to become
single again.  And yes-let me placate
your ego-you are the inspiration for
this bold and momentous decision,
for which I'll probably be ostracized
at both school and home. You ask me
who I choose, I choose you.

DANTE
So what are you saying?

CAITLIN
You're such an asshole.

DANTE
I'm just kidding.

CAITLIN
I can already tell this isn't going
to work.

DANTE
I'll ask Randal to close up for me
when he gets back.

CAITLIN
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought
he'd be at your side, like an obedient
lapdog.

DANTE
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't
gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll
just lock the store up and leave him
a note.

CAITLIN
You're too responsible. But no. I
have to go home first. They don't
even know I left school. And I should
break the disengagement news to my
mother, which is going to cause quite
a row, considering she loves Sang.

DANTE
Who doesn't?

CAITLIN
Well, me I guess.
(gathering herself to
go)
So, I shall take my leave of you,
but I will return in a little while,
at which time-yes-I would love to go
for dinner and a movie with you.

DANTE
What happened to the walk and the
nakedness?

CAITLIN
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.
(she kisses his cheek)
See you later, handsome.

DANTE watches her leave. He then explodes in jubilance.

DANTE
YES!

RANDAL enters carrying videos.

RANDAL
Get to work.

DANTE
(takes videos)
What'd you rent?
(reads)
Best of Both Worlds?

RANDAL
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with
both organs. You should see the box:
Beautiful women with dicks that put
mine to shame.

DANTE
And this is what you rented?

RANDAL
I like to expand my horizons.

DANTE
I got fined for selling cigarettes
to a minor.

RANDAL
No way!

DANTE
Five hundred dollars.

RANDAL
You're bullshitting.

DANTE hands him the summons. RANDAL reads it.

RANDAL
I didn't think they even enforced
this.

DANTE
(points to himself)
Living proof.

RANDAL
I thought you never sold cigarettes
to kids.

DANTE
I don't; you did.

RANDAL
(pause)
Really?

DANTE
Little girl. Maybe five years old?

RANDAL
(taken aback)
Holy shit. That girl?

DANTE
As opposed to the hundreds of other
children you let buy cigarettes
whenever you work here.

RANDAL
Then how come you got the fine?

DANTE
Because I'm here.

RANDAL
(incredulous)
You're lying.

DANTE
I swear. I couldn't make this kind
of hell up.

RANDAL
Then why aren't you like screaming
at me right now?

DANTE
Because I'm happy.

RANDAL
You're happy?

DANTE
I'm happy.

RANDAL
You're happy to get a fine?

DANTE
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came
to see me.

RANDAL
Now I know you're lying.

DANTE
I'm not. She just left.

RANDAL
What did she say?

DANTE
She's not going to marry that guy.
She went home to tell her mother.

RANDAL
You're kidding.

DANTE
I'm not.

RANDAL
(takes it in for a
moment)
Wow. You've had quite an evening.

DANTE
She went home, she's getting ready,
and we're going out.

RANDAL
I feel so ineffectual. Is there
anything I can do for you?

DANTE
Watch the store while I go home and
change.

RANDAL
What happened to title dictates
behavior?

DANTE
This is my way of spitting water at
life.

RANDAL
(suddenly aware)
Hey, what about Veronica?

DANTE
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want
to think about that now. Let me enjoy
this hour of bliss. I'll think about
all of that later. In the meantime,
nobody mentions the V word.

RANDAL
You're a snake.

DANTE
In my absence, try not to sell
cigarettes to any newborns.

RANDAL
You want me to bring the VCR over
here so we can watch this?

DANTE
I might be leaving early to go out
with Caitlin, in which case you'll
have to close the store tonight.

RANDAL
All right, but you're missing out.
Chicks with dicks.

DANTE
(puts cats on counter)
I'll read the book.

DANTE exits. A CUSTOMER comes back to the counter. He pets
the cat.

CUSTOMER
Cute cat. What's his name.

RANDAL
Peptic ulcer.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

JAY and SILENT BOB watch as DANTE passes. A small group of
burners are poised around the store door. JAY carefully writes
on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker.  SILENT BOB
hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large piece of
paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off a few
pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store door.
It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK!

Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his
face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he
is saying he eats cock. The small group laughs hysterically.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

CAITLIN enters, carrying an overnight bag. RANDAL is watching
his porno. The porno is loud and lewd. CAITLIN stares.

CAITLIN
Randal Graves-scourge of the video
renter.

RANDAL
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian
Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!

CAITLIN
You saw that article? God, isn't it
awful? My mother sent that in.

RANDAL
I take it she likes the guy.

CAITLIN
You'd think she was marrying him.
What are you watching?

RANDAL
Children's programming. What did
your mom say when you told her you
weren't engaged anymore?

CAITLIN
She said not to come home until
graduation.

RANDAL
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

CAITLIN
What can I say? He does weird things
to me.

RANDAL
Can I watch?

CAITLIN
You can hold me down.

RANDAL
Can I join in?

CAITLIN
You might be let down. I'm not a
hermaphrodite.

RANDAL
Few are. So what makes you think you
can maintain a relationship with
Dante this time around?

CAITLIN
A woman's intuition. Something in me
says it's time to give the old boy a
serious try.

RANDAL
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order
some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?

CAITLIN
Dick.

RANDAL
Exactly.

CAITLIN
So where is he?

RANDAL
He went home to change for the big
date.

CAITLIN
God, isn't he great?

RANDAL
(indicating TV)
No, this is great.

CAITLIN
Can I use the bathroom?

RANDAL
There's no light back there.

CAITLIN
Why aren't there any lights?

RANDAL
Well, there are, but for some reason
they stop working at five-fourteen
every night.

CAITLIN
You're kidding.

RANDAL
Nobody can figure it out. And the
boss doesn't want to pay the
electrician to fix it, because the
electrician owes money to the video
store.

CAITLIN
Such a sordid state of affair.

RANDAL
And I'm caught in the middle-torn
between my loyalty for the boss, and
my desire to piss with the light on.

CAITLIN
I'll try to manage.

She heads toward the back.

RANDAL
Hey Caitlin...
(cautionary)
Break his heart again this time, and
I'll kill you. Nothing personal.

CAITLIN
You're very protective of him, Randal.
You always have been.

RANDAL
Territoriality. He was mine first.

CAITLIN
(rubs his head)
Awww. That was so cute.

She kisses his forehead and walks away. The MOTHER and SMALL
CHILD (Happy Scrappy) come to the counter.

MOTHER
(oblivious of the TV)
A pack of cigarettes.

The SMALL CHILD points at the TV screen.

SMALL CHILD
Cunt!

CUT TO:

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

RANDAL studies the I EAT COCK word balloon. DANTE enters.

DANTE
Who eats cock?

RANDAL
Bunch of savages in this town.
(recalling)
Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might
want to see if she's okay; she's
been back there a long time.

DANTE
There's no lights back there.

RANDAL
I told her that. She said she didn't
need any. Why don't you join her,
man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.

DANTE
I love your sexy talk. It's so...
kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.

RANDAL
Fuck you.

The cooler door is heard opening. CAITLIN walks lazily down
the convenience store aisle. She looks very satisfied. DANTE
and RANDAL regard her curiously. She joins them, latching on
to DANTE's arm, lovingly.

CAITLIN
How'd you get here so fast?

DANTE
I left like an hour ago.

CAITLIN
(regards him curiously)
Do you always talk weird after you
violate women?

RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused.

RANDAL
Maybe the Asian design major slipped
her some opium?

DANTE
Could be.

CAITLIN
(hugging DANTE)
Promise me it'll always be like that.

DANTE
Like what?

CAITLIN
When you just lie perfectly still
and let me do everything.

DANTE
Um... okay.

RANDAL
Am I missing something here?

CAITLIN
I went back there, and Dante was
already waiting for me.

RANDAL
He was?

CAITLIN
It was so cool. He didn't say a word.
He was just... ready, you know?  And
we didn't kiss or talk or anything.
He just sat there and let me do all
the work.

RANDAL
(to DANTE)
You dog! I didn't see you go back
there.

DANTE is bewildered.

CAITLIN
And the fact that there weren't any
lights made it so...
(she lets out a growl
and hugs DANTE)
God! That was so great!

DANTE
(quietly)
It wasn't me.

CAITLIN
(laughing it off)
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?

DANTE
(to RANDAL)
Was it you?

RANDAL
I was here the whole time.

CAITLIN
(half-laughing)
You two better quit it.

DANTE
I'm serious.

CAITLIN
(beat)
We didn't just have sex in the
bathroom?

DANTE
No.

Everyone is silent. Then...

CAITLIN
Stop this. This isn't funny.

DANTE
I'm not kidding. I just got back
from outside.

CAITLIN
(covering her chest)
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!

DANTE
I'm not fooling around!
(to RANDAL)
Who went back there?

RANDAL
Nobody! I swear!

CAITLIN
I feel nauseous.

DANTE
Are you sure somebody was back there?

CAITLIN
(hits DANTE)
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus,
I'm going to be sick!

RANDAL
You just fucked a total stranger?

DANTE
Shut the fuck up!

CAITLIN
I can't believe this! I feel faint...

DANTE
(to RANDAL)
Call the police.

RANDAL
Why?

CAITLIN
No, don't!

DANTE
There's a strange man in our bathroom,
and he just raped Caitlin!

CAITLIN
(weakly)
Oh God...

RANDAL
She said she did all the work.

DANTE
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?
(pause)
WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. LATER

THE OLD MAN'S FACE is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a
stretcher. (Same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom.)

CORONER (O.S.)
Who is he?

The body bag zipper is pulled closed. DANTE, the CORONER,
and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. The
CORONER takes notes.

DANTE
I don't know. He just came in and
asked to use the bathroom.

CORONER
What time was this?

DANTE
Um... I don't know.
(to RANDAL)
What time did hockey end?

RANDAL
Around three or something.

DANTE
What time did we go to the funeral?

RANDAL
I think four.

CORONER
Wait a second? Who was working here
today?

DANTE
Just me.

CORONER
I thought you just said you played
hockey and went to a funeral.

DANTE
We did.

CORONER
Then who operated the store?

DANTE
Nobody. It was closed.

CORONER
With this guy locked in?

DANTE
Everything happened at once. I guess
I forgot he was back there.

Ambulance attendants join them.

ATTENDANT 1
Can we take this now?

CORONER
Go ahead.

The stretcher is wheeled out. Midway down the body bag,
something protrudes, pushing the bag up. It is an erection.
RANDAL stares at it.

DANTE
Was he alive when... Caitlin...

CORONER
No. I place the time of death at
about three-twenty.

RANDAL
Then how could she... you know...

CORONER
The body can maintain an erection
after expiration. Sometimes for hours.
Did he have the adult magazine when
he came in?

DANTE
No. I gave it to him.

RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief.

DANTE
Well he asked me for it!

CORONER
(continuing)
I can't say for certain until we get
him back to the lab, but my guess is
he was masturbating, his heart seized
and he died. That's when the girl
found him.
(sniffing the air)
Something smells like shoe polish.

RANDAL
(to CORONER)
This has gotta be the weirdest thing
you've ever been called in on.

CORONER
(writing)
Actually, I once had to tag a kid
that broke his neck trying to put
his mouth on his penis.

RANDAL looks down, anonymously.

DANTE
What about Caitlin?

CORONER
Shock trauma. She's going to need
years of therapy after this. My
question is, How did she come to
have sex with the dead man?

DANTE
She thought it was me.

The CORONER stares at DANTE.

CORONER
What kind of convenience store do
you run here?

He exits. DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor.

RANDAL
(beat)
Do you think he was talking about my
cousin?

CUT TO:

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

CAITLIN sits in the back of the ambulance, a blanket draped
over her shoulders. An attendant takes her blood pressure.
The doors are closed and the vehicle speeds away. JAY and
SILENT BOB lean against the wall. JAY eats sugar out of a
box.

JAY
I knew one of those motherfuckers
was gonna kill somebody one day.

CUT TO:

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

A jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip. Once in the
condiment, the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin.

Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly
to and fro across the jar.

RANDAL (O.S.)
(mumbling Jaws theme)
Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM!  DA-
DUM! DA-DUM!

DANTE and RANDAL are on a freezer case. RANDAL pushes this
chip around the jar of salsa. DANTE stares up at the ceiling,
oblivious.

RANDAL
Salsa shark.

DANTE says nothing.

RANDAL
(as Brody)
"We're gonna need a bigger boat."

DANTE says even less than nothing.

RANDAL
(as Quint)
"Man goes into the cage; cage goes
into the salsa; shark's in the salsa;
our shark."

DANTE... you know.

RANDAL
(angry)
What? What's with you? You haven't
said anything for like twenty minutes.
What the hell is your problem?

DANTE
This life.

RANDAL
This life?

DANTE
Why do I have this life?

RANDAL
Have some chips; you'll feel better.

DANTE
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less
than slave wages, working on my day
off, dealing with every backward
fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel
shutters are locked all day, I smell
like shoe polish, I've got an ex-
girlfriend who's catatonic after
fucking a dead guy, and my present
girlfriend has sucked thirty-six
dicks.

RANDAL
Thirty-seven.

DANTE
My life is in the shitter right about
now, so if you don't mind, I'd like
to stew a bit.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)
You open?

RANDAL
Yeah.

RANDAL hops off the freezer case and steps O.C.

RANDAL (O.S.)
That's all bullshit. You know what
the real problem here is?

DANTE
I was born.

RANDAL comes back.

RANDAL
You should shit or get off the pot.

DANTE
I should shit or get off the pot.

RANDAL
Yeah, you should shit or get off the
pot.

DANTE
What are you talking about?

RANDAL
I'm talking about this thing you
have... this inability to improve
your situation in life.

DANTE
Fuck you.

RANDAL
It's true. You'll sit there and blame
life for dealing a cruddy hand, never
once accepting the responsibility
for the way your situation is.

DANTE
What responsibility?

RANDAL
All right, if you hate this job and
the people, and the fact that you
have to come in on your day off,
then quit.

DANTE
As if it's that easy.

RANDAL
It is. You just up and quit. There
are other jobs, and they pay better
money. You're bound to be qualified
for at least one of them. So what's
stopping you?

DANTE
Leave me alone.

RANDAL
You're comfortable. This is a life
of convenience for you, and any
attempt to change it would shatter
the pathetic microcosm you've
fashioned for yourself.

DANTE
Oh, like your life's any better?

RANDAL
I'm satisfied with my situation for
now. You don't hear me bitching.
You, on the other hand, have been
bitching all day.

DANTE
Thank you. Why don't you go back to
the video store?

RANDAL
It's the same thing with Veronica.

DANTE
Leave her out of this.

RANDAL
You date Veronica because she's low
maintenance and because it's
convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever
do is talk about Caitlin. You carry
a torch for a girl you dated in high
school-in high school for God's sake!
You're twenty-two!

DANTE
Leave me alone.

RANDAL
If you want Caitlin, then face
Veronica, tell her, and be with
Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be
with Veronica. But don't pine for
one and fuck the other. Man, if you
weren't such a fucking coward...

DANTE
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.
(chuckles)
It must be so great to be able to
simplify everything the way you do.

RANDAL
Am I right or what?

DANTE
You're wrong. Things happened today,
okay? Things that probably ruined my
chances with Caitlin.

RANDAL
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over
fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's
been fucking a dead guy for thirty
years; I call him Dad.

DANTE
Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible.

RANDAL
Melodrama coming from you seems about
as natural as an oral bowel movement.

DANTE
What do you want me to say? Yes, I
suppose some of the things you're
saying may be true. But that's the
way things are; it's not going to
change.

RANDAL
Make them change.

DANTE
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you
leave me alone? I can't make changes
like that in my life. If I could, I
would-but I don't have the ability
to risk comfortable situations on
the big money and the fabulous prizes.

RANDAL
Who're you kidding? You can so.

DANTE
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!

RANDAL
So you'll continue being miserable
all the time, just because you don't
have the guts to face change?

DANTE
(sadly)
My mother told me once that when I
as three, my potty lid was closed,
and instead of lifting it, I chose
to shit my pants.

RANDAL
Lovely story.

DANTE
Point is-I'm not the kind of person
that disrupts things in order to
shit comfortably.

DANTE crosses O.C. RANDAL appears contemplative.

Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed,
smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking
beers!
(to DANTE)
A pack of wraps, my good man. It's
time to kick back, drink some beers,
and smoke some weed!

DANTE
Done poisoning the youth for the
day?

JAY
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now
I'm gonna head over to Atlantic,
drink some beers, get ripped, and-
please God-get laid.
(pulls out money)
E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.

DANTE
One seventy-nine.

JAY
(to SILENT BOB)
Pay the good man.
(to DANTE)
Don't you close soon?

DANTE
A half hour.

JAY
We get off about the same time every
night. We should hang out.  You get
high?

DANTE
I should start.

JAY
Wanna come to this party tonight?
There's gonna be some pussy there,
man!

DANTE
With you? I don't think so.

JAY
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't
hang out with drug dealers."

DANTE
Nothing personal.

SILENT BOB hands weed to JAY.

JAY
I work, just like you. You're more
of a crook than I am, dude.

DANTE
How do you figure... HEY! You can't
roll a joint in here!

JAY
(rolling a joint)
Relax brother. What I mean is that
you sell the stuff in this store at
the highest prices around. A dollar
seventy-nine for wraps-what's that
shit?

DANTE
It's not my store.

JAY
And these aren't my drugs-I just
sell them.

DANTE
The difference is you exploit a
weakness.

JAY
What's that mean?

DANTE
You sell to people that can't stay
away from an addiction.

JAY
All right. How much is Pepsi here?

DANTE
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

JAY
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents,
plus tax.

DANTE
So.

JAY
So why do you sell it for so much
more? I'll tell you why-because people
come here and they're like "A dollar
eighty for soda? I should get it at
Food City. But I don't feel like
driving there. I'll just buy it here
so I don't have to drive up there."
That's exploiting a weakness, too,
isn't it?

DANTE
I can't believe you just rolled a
joint in here.

JAY
Hey, man, what happened with that
old guy?

DANTE
He died in the bathroom.

JAY
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was
jerkin' off.

DANTE
I don't know. I wasn't watching.

JAY
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I
know I felt like beatin' it when I
saw her.
(pantomimes sex)
Come here, bitch! You like this? Is
this what you want? Hunhh?

DANTE
Knock it off. That used to be my
girlfriend.

JAY
You used to go out with her?

DANTE
We were going to start again, I think.

JAY
Don't you already have a girlfriend?

DANTE
Veronica.

JAY
Is she that girl who's down here all
the time? She came here today carrying
a plate of food.

DANTE
Lasagne.

JAY
And what-you were gonna dump her to
date that Caitlin chick?

DANTE
Maybe.

JAY
I don't know dude. That Caitlin
chick's nice. But I see that Veronica
girl doing shit for you all the time.
She brings you food, she rubs your
back... Didn't I see her change your
tire one day?

DANTE
I jacked the car up. All she did was
loosen the nuts and put the tire on.

JAY
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.

DANTE
She's my girlfriend.

JAY
I've had girlfriends, but all they
wanted from me was weed and shit.
(beat)
Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which
is better: a good plate with nothing
on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She
said "What's a good-looking plate
with nothing on it?"

DANTE
Meaning?

JAY
I don't know. She was senile and
shit. Used to piss herself all the
time. C'mon Silent Bob.

Exit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there.

SILENT BOB
You know, there's a million fine-
looking women in the world, but they
don't all bring you lasagne at work.
Most of them just cheat on you.

SILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the
bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in
deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open.

DANTE

He's right. I love her.

RANDAL
So that's it. He doesn't love you

VERONICA stares, dumbfounded.

VERONICA
And... he told you all of this?

RANDAL
Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part-that's just my
theory.

VERONICA
I... I don't know what to say.

RANDAL
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.
It's not your fault. It's Dante.

I don't know thing one about chicks.
Do you want to cry or something? I
can leave.

VERONICA
I'm not sad.

RANDAL
You're not?

VERONICA
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed
off. I feel like he's been killing
time while he tries to grow the balls
to tell me how he really feels, and
then he can't even do it!  He has
his friend do it for him!

RANDAL
He didn't ask me to...

VERONICA
After all that I've done for that
fuck! And he wants to be with that
slut? Fine! He can have his slut!

RANDAL
Um, do you think you can give me a
lift home tonight?

VERONICA
(oblivious of RANDAL)
I'm going to have a word with that
asshole.

VERONICA storms out.

RANDAL
Wait!  Veronica... I don't think...

RANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby.

RANDAL
(to customer)
What am I worried about?  He'll
probably be glad I started the ball
rolling. All he ever did was complain
about her anyway. I'm just looking
out for his best interests.  I mean,
that's what a friend does, am I right?
I did him a favor.

If you didn't want to go out with me

Instead, you pussyfoot around and
see that slut behind my back!

DANTE
What're you talking about?

VERONICA
(kicks him)
You've been talking to her on the
phone for weeks!

DANTE
It was only a few times...

VERONICA
And then you pull that shit this
morning, freaking out because I've
gone down on a couple guys!

DANTE
A couple...?

VERONICA
(throws purse at him)
I'm not the one trying to patch things
up with my ex, sneaking around behind
your back! And if you think that
thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then
just wait, mister: I'm going to put
the hookers in Times Square to shame
with all the guys I go down on now!

DANTE
Would you let me explain...

VERONICA
Explain what? How you were waiting
until the time was right, and then
you were going to dump me for her?

DANTE
(getting up)
Veronica... I... it's not like that
anymore... I mean, it was never really
like that...

VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down, yelling
in pain.

VERONICA
You're damn right it's not like that!
Because I won't let it be like that!
You want your slut? Fine!  The slut
is yours!

DANTE
I don't want Caitlin...

VERONICA
You don't know what you want, but
I'm not going to sit here anymore
holding your hand until you figure
it out! I've encouraged you to get
out of this fucking dump and go back
to school, to take charge of your
life and find direction. I even
transferred so maybe you would be
more inclined to go back to college
if I was with you. Everyone said it
was a stupid move, but I didn't care
because I loved you and wanted to
see you pull yourself out of this
senseless funk you've been in since
that whore dumped you, oh so many
years ago. And now you want to go
back to her so she can fuck you over
some more?

DANTE
I don't want to go back with her...

VERONICA
Of course not; not now! You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out
of doing what you wanted to do. Well,
I won't let you. I want you to follow
through on this, just so you can
find out what a fucking idiot you
are. And when she dumps you again-
and she will, Dante, I promise you
that-when she dumps you again, I
want to laugh at you, right in your
face, just so you realize that that
was what you gave up our relationship
for!
(grabs her purse)
I'm just glad Randal had the balls
to tell me, since you couldn't.

DANTE
(weakly)
Randal...?

VERONICA
And having him tell me... that was
just the weakest move ever. You're
spineless.

Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside.

RANDAL
Dante?

Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.
DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL
throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back
into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs
a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the
opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at
his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin
over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.

DANTE paws at his eyes. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and smacks
it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly. DANTE chases
him out of the frame. M&M's scatter wildly across the empty
floor, and the ruckus is heard O.C.

CUT TO:

DANTE and RANDAL later, out of breath, on the floor. RANDAL
sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. DANTE lies
on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies,
ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.

RANDAL
How's your eye?

DANTE
(reluctantly)
The swelling's not so bad. But the
FDS stings.
(then)
How's your neck?

RANDAL
It's hard to swallow.

They are both silent. Then...

RANDAL
You didn't have to choke me.

DANTE
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
that I was going to dump her for
Caitlin?

RANDAL
I thought I was doing you a favor.

DANTE
Thanks.

RANDAL
You were saying how you couldn't
initiate change yourself, so I figured
I'd help you out.

DANTE
Jesus.

Silence. Then...

RANDAL
You still didn't have to choke me.

DANTE
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
kill you.

RANDAL
Why do you say that?

DANTE
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget
it.

RANDAL
No, really. What did I do that was
so wrong?

DANTE
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes
it seems like the only reason you
come to work is to make my life
miserable.

RANDAL
How do you figure?

DANTE
What time did you get to work today?

RANDAL
Like ten after.

DANTE
You were over half an hour late.
Then all you do is come over here.

RANDAL
To talk to you.

DANTE
Which means the video store is
ostensibly closed.

RANDAL
It's not like I'm miles away.

DANTE
Unless you're out renting videos at
other video stores.

RANDAL
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
could watch it together!

DANTE
You get my slapped with a fine, you
fight with the customers and I have
to patch everything up. You get us
chased out of a funeral by violating
a corpse. To top it all off, you
ruin my relationship. What's your
encore? Do you anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?
(sighs)
You know what the real tragedy is?
I'm not even supposed to be here
today!

RANDAL
(suddenly outraged)
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
you trying to pass the buck again.
I'm the source of all your misery.
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to attend a
wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
girlfriend without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?
You wanna blame somebody, blame
yourself.
(beat, as DANTE)
"I'm not even supposed to be here
today."
(whips stuff at DANTE)
You sound like an asshole. Whose
choice was it to be here today?
Nobody twisted your arm. You're here
today of your own violation, my
friend. But you'd like to believe
that the weight of the world rests
on your shoulders-that the store
would crumble if Dante wasn't here.
Well, I got news for you, jerk: This
store would survive without you.
Without me either. All you do is
overcompensate for having what's
basically a monkey's job:
You push fucking buttons. Any moron
can waltz in here and do our jobs,
but you're obsessed with making it
seem so much more fucking important,
so much more epic than it really is.
You work in a convenience store,
Dante. And badly, I might add. And I
work in a shitty video store.  Badly,
as well.
(beat)
You know, that guy Jay's got it right-
he has no delusions about what he
does. Us?  We like to make ourselves
seem so much better than the people
that come in here, just looking to
pick up a paper or-God forbid-
cigarettes. We look down on them, as
it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're
so fucking advanced, then what are
we doing working here?

RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong words
alone.

CUT TO:

DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

CUT TO:

DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

RANDAL
I threw out the stuff that got broken.
The floor looks clean.

DANTE
You need a ride?

RANDAL
(looks out door)
Got one. Just pulled up.

They stand in silence. Then...

DANTE
Do you work tomorrow?

RANDAL
Same time. What about you?

DANTE
I'm calling out. Going to hit the
hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
try to see Veronica.

RANDAL
You wanna grab something to eat
tomorrow night... after I get out of
here?

DANTE
I'll call you. Let you know.

RANDAL
All right. Good luck with Veronica.
If you want, I can talk to her, you
know, and explain...

DANTE
No thanks. I'll take care of it.
We've got a lot of shit to talk about.

RANDAL
Helluva day.

DANTE
To say the least.

RANDAL
Do you need a hug or something?
'Cause I would have no hang-ups about
hugging you... you know, you being a
guy and all. Just don't knead my ass
when you do it.

DANTE
Get the fuck outta here already.

RANDAL
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
the sheet-sign.

RANDAL
You're closed.

He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

DANTE
What'd you forget something?
(looks up, surprised)
Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

CREDITS

Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
a clerk, looks down the aisles.

CUSTOMER
Hello? Little help?

No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY

"HEAD OVER HEELS" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a
flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to
discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.
But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the
blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.

We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade
card. She holds it up  OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts and
glitter surrounding and "Good Luck Tonight!" and "Elle and
Warner forever!."

She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
the hall, into the room of --

THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom
routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card
Girl out and into the room of --

A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a
Stairmaster as "General Hospital" plays on a tiny TV. She
signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to
the room of --

A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --

A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE
GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being
signed, as the drinks go the other.

Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we follow
her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the
very last and biggest door --

She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
the card under the door.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of
UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua  who picks it up in his mouth and
trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in strappy
sandals.

An equally perfectly manicured hand with a "Sisters Forever"
charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.

As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned
legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal
a magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta
Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.

ELLE
(into the phone)
I love you, too!

Behind her, a "Go USC" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A
stack of "Cosmopolitan"s and "Glamour"s teeters on the
dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
in a predominance of pink.

ELLE
(into phone)
I'll see you tonight.

She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's
head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,
touched.

ELLE
"Elle and Warner forever". Aww...

Underdog yips.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

A Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful
college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
who they're going to sleep with next.

The main wall of the living room has been designated as a
"Model Wall" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from
a Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A
cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a
USC cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde
SERENA in a pom-pom pose.

Serena walks up, fending off an admirer.

SERENA
Jeremy, enough! I am not going to
formal with you.

Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated.

MARGOT
Can someone please tell Rick that he
is not the only Sigma Chi with a big
penis?

ELLE (O.S.)
You guys are so sweet!

ELLE, a vision of fluffy blondeness, runs down the stairs
toward Serena and Margot, holding the card.

ELLE
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen
tonight --

SERENA
Helloo... he just had lunch with his
grandmother. You know he got "The
Rock".

MARGOT
Why else would she have flown in
from Newport? It's not like she'd
Fed Ex a six carat diamond.

ELLE
(excited)
You think?

SERENA
I can't believe you're getting
engaged!

The three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging.

ELLE
C'mon -- you have to help me pick
out the perfect outfit.

As they head toward the door, Elle spots Amy, a shy girl in
a delta gamma pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.

ELLE
Amy, what's wrong?

AMY
I don't really -- know anyone.

ELLE
(teasing)
That's because you spend too much
time in the library. Come with me.
(to Serena and Margot)
I'll meet you outside.

As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma
Chi brothers.

ELLE
Brandon, Jason, Grant -- this is
Amy. Why don't you tell her about
the time you guys went golfing naked?

Elle winks at Amy and heads off as the guys launch into their
story.

BRANDON
It was classic. Jason hit with wood
all day.

GRANT
And we never ran out of balls --

Amy laughs.

INT. SUNSET PLAZA BOUTIQUE - DAY

Serena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror,
trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress. Sexy and ultra-
tight.

ELLE
Too demure?

MARGOT
I think you should go with red. It's
the color of confidence.

ELLE
Well, I don't want to look like I
know what's coming...

SERENA
I don't understand why you're
completely disregarding your signature
color.

She holds up a tiny pink slipdress.

ELLE
He's proposing! I can't look like I
would on any date. This is the date.
The night I'll always remember. I
want to look special. Bridal... but
not like I suspect anything.

ACROSS THE STORE

A SALESWOMAN looks at her cohort.

SALESWOMAN
(sotto)
There's nothing I love more than a
dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.

She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack, ripping off
the "HALF PRICE" TAG.

ON ELLE AND THE GIRLS

SERENA
I can't wait to see you wearing The
Rock!

Elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.

ELLE
What if -- you know -- it's not the
night?

MARGOT
Why else would he be taking you to
The Ivy? You've been dating for a
year -- it's not like he's trying to
impress you.

SERENA
Elle, you've heard the man pass gas
in his sleep. That practically means
you're pre-engaged.

The Saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on
her face.

SALESWOMAN
Did you see this one? We just got it
in yesterday.

Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back
at the saleswoman, excited.

ELLE
Is this a low-viscosity rayon?

SALESWOMAN
Uh, yes -- of course.

ELLE
With half-loop top-stitching on the
hem?

SALESWOMAN
(smiling a lie)
Absolutely. It's one of a kind.

Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be
excited.

ELLE
It's impossible to use a half-loop
topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It
would snag the fabric. And you didn't
just get this in, because I remember
it from the June Vogue a year ago,
so if you're trying to sell it to me
at full price, you picked the wrong
girl.

The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.

MARGOT
(to the saleswoman)
Nice try...

Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips
on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check,
smoothing down her golden mane.

ELLE
(dramatically)
Girls, this is it. In a few hours,
I'll be the future Mrs. Warner
Huntington III.

EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - NIGHT

An attractive male finger presses the doorbell.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT - SAME TIME

Amy peeks through the peephole and turns.

AMY
(whispering)
He's here!

Elle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several
other DG's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath,
opening the door to find --

WARNER HUNTINGTON, III, 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously
handsome. He takes her in, a smile spreading across his face.

WARNER
You're beautiful.

ELLE
So are you!

She looks up at him, blushing and completely smitten. They
kiss. After a moment, Warner extracts himself.

WARNER
(nervous)
You ready?

Her face is awash with devotion.

ELLE
I am so ready.

EXT. THE IVY - NIGHT

Warner and Elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio.

Elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute.

Nervous and excited.

ELLE
Here's to us.

Warner is slower to sip his.

WARNER
The reason I wanted to come here
tonight was to discuss our future.

Elle is on the edge of her seat.

ELLE
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.

WARNER
I mean, we're having a lot of fun
now -- but things are gonna be
different when I'm at Harvard. Law
school is a completely different
world. I need to be serious.

ELLE
Of course.

WARNER
My family expects a lot from me. And
I expect a lot from me. I plan on
running for office some day.

ELLE
And I fully support that.

WARNER
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a
senator by the time I'm thirty -- I
can't keep dicking around.

ELLE
I completely agree.

WARNER
That's why I think it's time for us
to --

Elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation.

WARNER
I think we should break up.

Elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and CRASHES onto
the patio.

ELLE
What?

Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.

WARNER
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --

ELLE
You're breaking up with me?!
(tearing up)
I thought you were proposing.

WARNER
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be
a politician, I need to marry a
Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.

ELLE
(stunned)
You're breaking up with me because
I'm too -- blonde?

WARNER
That's not entirely --

ELLE
Then what? My boobs are too big?

WARNER
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --

Her tears start.

ELLE
So when you said you'd always love
me, you were just "dicking around"?

Warner looks around the restaurant nervously.

WARNER
I do love you, Elle. I just can't
marry you. You have no idea the
pressure I'm under. My family has
five generations of senators. My
brother is in the top three at Yale
Law. He just got engaged to a
Vanderbilt, for crissakes.

Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face,
then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.

WARNER
It's not like I have a choice,
sweetheart.

He follows her out.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three
inch heels, sobbing. Warner pulls up alongside her in his
convertible Saab.

WARNER
C'mon. Let me take you home.

ELLE
No.

WARNER
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to
campus.

Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying.

Catching her poofy little purse in the door. She re-opens
it, yanking the purse back in. Warner pulls out.

EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - USC - NIGHT

Warner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night.

Everything should be perfect. It's not.

Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out.

WARNER
Elle, believe me, I never expected
to be doing this, but I think it's
the right thing to do.

ELLE
How can it be the right thing if
we're not together?

WARNER
I have to think about my future. And
what people expect from me.

ELLE
So you're breaking up with me because
you're afraid your family won't like
me?
(through her tears)
Everybody likes me!

WARNER
East coast people are different.

ELLE
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
all of a sudden I'm white trash? I
grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across
the street from Aaron Spelling! I
think most people would agree that's
way better than a Vanderbilt --

WARNER
I told you, Elle. I need someone --
serious.

ELLE
I'm seriously in love with you --
Isn't that enough?

He looks away.

WARNER
I'm sorry.

She gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to
her sorority house. When she's at the top, she turns back to
look at him. His perfect cheekbones highlighted by the
streetlamp.

He meets her eyes, pained, but determined. Then pulls away,
leaving her there.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - USC - NIGHT

Elle walks down the pink and green carpeted hall, dazed and
tear-stained.

Margot and Serena emerge from the bathroom, post-shower.
Getting ready for a night out.

MARGOT
Why are you back so soon?

Serena sees Elle's bare hand.

SERENA
Did he forget the ring?

Elle silently walks into her room. Serena and Margot follow,
worried.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Elle slumps down in an inflatable chair, hugging her knees
and cowering in a wretched little ball. Underdog stares at
her, concerned.

Serena and Margot stand in the door.

MARGOT
Elle?

SERENA
Where's the Rock?

ELLE
We're not engaged. It's over!

SERENA AND MARGOT
WHAT?!

ELLE
He broke up with me!

Serena and Margot gasp in horror, rushing to her side.

SERENA
Is it a Kappa?

MARGOT
It's not a Theta --

ELLE
No -- it's just -- not me.

SERENA
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll
blacklist Sigma Chi.

ELLE
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

SERENA
What happened?

Elle starts to lose it again.

ELLE
I don't know! Everything was normal
at first and then he said he needed
someone more --
(sob-choked)
Serious!

MARGOT
Serious?! Who the hell does he think
he is? You're the most popular month
on the USC calendar!

She points to Elle's "Miss June" page, hanging on the wall.

SERENA
Oh, he is so over on this campus.

ELLE
I just don't understand what went
wrong --

MARGOT
Maybe it's the grandmother. Have you
ever met her?

Elle wipes her face.

ELLE
Last month on his birthday. And she
liked me! She said I looked like
Britney Spears. Why would you say
that to someone you didn't like?

They shrug, mystified.

SERENA
How could this happen?

ELLE
I don't know! I don't know anything
any more!
(wiping a tear)
I just need to be by myself.

SERENA
Are you sure?

Elle nods. The girls rise, hugging her.

MARGOT
We still love you. Sisters forever!

ELLE
(sniffling)
Thank you. I love you, too.

As they go, Margot looks at Serena.

MARGOT
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think
I'm serious enough?

SERENA
Helloo... you let him have anal sex
with you.
(TV VERSION)
Helloo... you let him videotape you
diddling yourself.

MARGOT
You're right. Phew!

As the girls go, they shut the door behind them.

Elle gets up and grabs a FRAMED PHOTO of Warner, then lies
down on her bed, clutching it to her heart. Underdog leaps
up and gives her little doggy kisses.

EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY

The sun rises on a sad day. "HOPELESSLY DEVOTED" by Olivia
Newton-John plays.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Amy knocks on Elle's door.

AMY
Elle?

ANOTHER SISTER passes.

ANOTHER SISTER
(whispering)
Didn't you hear?

She leads a reluctant Amy down the hall.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY

Spread out on the bed are PICTURES of Elle and Warner: The
Sigma Chi formal; their Homecoming Queen and King "wave"; a
60's party; Mardi Gras night; beach weekend at Coronado.

Next to the pictures are thirty dried Ecuardorian long-stemmed
pink roses, remnants of their one year anniversary.

In the center sits Elle, wearing Warner's old oversized Sigma
Chi t-shirt, clutching a Gund teddybear. Depressed and looking
like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante.

ELLE
I just love him so much! I loved him
the first moment I saw him. He's
beautiful and smart and someone I
totally respect. And I did everything
I could to make him love me, but it
wasn't enough. Now what am I supposed
to do? I planned my whole future
around him. My life was going to be
all about Warner. Now what's it going
to be about?

She looks up -- waiting. Staring back at her is Underdog --
who sadly has no answers for her.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY

Elle remains in bed, Underdog now clutched to her chest,
soaps on the TV.

TV SOAP STUD
(on TV)
"Oh, darling. I'll love you forever."

ELLE
(teary)
Bullshit!

Serena and Margot enter, bearing Jamba Juice.

MARGOT
Honey, stop! You have to leave this
room -- it's been a week.

ELLE
So?

Serena sits down on the edge of the bed, trying to psyche
Elle up.

SERENA
What's the thing that always makes
us feel better, no matter what?

MARGOT
Cunnilingus?

Elle lets out a wail, realizing what she'll be missing. Serena
shoots Margot a stern look.

SERENA
No -- the thing after that.

INT. UPSCALE MANICURE SHOP - DAY

A row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients.
Chattering away. Therapy in full session. Serena sits in
front of her regular nail technician.

SERENA
It was awful. We all thought she'd
be the first to walk down the aisle
and now she's totally adrift.

The nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-powerangst --
looking over at Elle, who sits in the waiting area, shell-
shocked, but showered. Elle picks up the only magazine left
on the table -- "Town & Country". She wrinkles her nose. An
OLD LADY next to her reads "Seventeen". Elle looks at her,
begrudging the access to teen beauty tips, and flips through
"Town & Country" noisily until she freezes on -- the
Engagement Section. She gasps.

ELLE
Oh, my God!

She looks at a PHOTO of a horse-faced YOUNG WOMAN standing
next to a THREE-YEARS-OLDER VERSION OF WARNER. She turns to
the old lady next to her.

ELLE
Do you know who this is?

The old lady looks.

OLD LADY
No.

ELLE
It's Warner's older brother!

OLD LADY
Who?

Elle continues, undaunted.

ELLE
He just got engaged to this -- this
very unfortunate-looking girl.
(reading)
"Third year Yale Law student Putnam
Bowes Huntington III and his fiancee
Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year
Yale Law."

She turns to the old lady.

ELLE
This is the type of girl Warner wants
to marry. This is what I need to
become to be serious.

The old lady looks at the picture.

OLD LADY
Butt ugly?

ELLE
No -- a law student.

Elle rushes out. Serena looks after her.

SERENA
Elle?
(turning back to her
nail technician)
She'll never get him back with those
cuticles.

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Elle sits in front of her ADVISOR.

ADVISOR
(flummoxed)
Harvard Law School?

ELLE
That's right.

ADVISOR
But it's a top three school --

ELLE
(offended)
I have a 4.0.

ADVISOR
Yes, but your major is Fashion
Merchandising. Harvard won't be
impressed that you aced "History of
Lycra". What are your backups?

ELLE
I don't need backups. Harvard is the
school I'm going to.

He decides to humor her.

ADVISOR
Well, then. You'll need excellent
recommendations from your professors,
a heck of an admissions essay and at
least a one-seventy-five on your
LSATs.

ELLE
(confident)
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty-
Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can
handle anything.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY

Elle sits on the floor surrounded by piles of LSAT prep books,
the framed photo of Warner, and Underdog.

There's a KNOCK at the door as Serena and Margot peek inside,
gasping in horror at the sight of books.

MARGOT
What are you doing?!

Elle smiles brightly at them.

ELLE
Reading about the LSATs.

Margot looks at Serena, confused.

SERENA
(in a horrified whisper)
My cousin had them. Apparently you
get a really bad rash on your --

Elle interrupts her.

ELLE
The LSATs are an exam.

She takes a deep breath.

ELLE
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!

SERENA
What, like on va-kay?

MARGOT
Let's all go! Road trip!

SERENA
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe.
Let's go there!

ELLE
No -- I'm going to law school at
Harvard.

They look at her, confused.

MARGOT
Why?!

SERENA
I mean, I know you're upset and all,
but can't you just take a sedative?

Elle rolls her eyes at their naivete.

ELLE
Once Warner sees me as a serious law
student, he'll want me back. It's a
completely brilliant plan!

MARGOT
But isn't it kind of hard to get
into law school?

ELLE
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!

Margot pulls something off her wrist and hands it to Elle.

MARGOT
Here. You're gonna need this.

ELLE
Your scrunchie?

MARGOT
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me
pass Spanish.

Serena rolls her eyes and looks at Margot disapprovingly.

SERENA
You passed Spanish because you gave
Professor Montoya a hand-job after
the final.

MARGOT
(duh)
Yeah, luckily.

A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT 3 MONTHS BEGINS WITH...

EXT. WOODS' BEL AIR BACKYARD - DAY

ON VIDEO, Elle sits in a Jacuzzi in her bikini.

ELLE
(to the camera)
My name is Elle Woods and for my
admissions essay, I'd like to tell
all of you at Harvard why I'm going
to make an amazing lawyer.

INT. KAPPA SIG LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The girls watch a horror movie with Kappa Sigs. Eating popcorn
and drinking red wine.

Off to the side, Elle reads an LSAT Study Guide.

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

ON VIDEO, a Delta Gamma chapter meeting takes place.

ELLE (V.O.)
As president of my sorority, I'm
skilled at commanding the attention
of a room and discussing important
issues.

Elle bangs a gavel, as she sits in front of her sisters.

ELLE
It has come to my attention that the
maintenance staff is switching our
toilet paper from Charmin to generic.
All those opposed to chafing, please
say "aye".

The sisters "AYE" in unison. Underdog barks his approval.

INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

"LSAT Prep Course" is written on the board. Elle and forty
other law school hopefuls take notes furiously as practice
questions are reviewed.

EXT. WOODS BACKYARD POOL - DAY

ON VIDEO, FROM ABOVE, we see Elle as she floats on a raft in
her pool, in a pink Versace bikini. She addresses the camera.

ELLE
(to the camera)
I'm able to recall hundreds of
important details at the drop of a
hat.

We reveal Margot on a raft beside her.

MARGOT
(badly acting)
Elle, do you know what happened on
"Days of Our Lives" yesterday?

ELLE
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again,
we joined Hope in the search for her
identity. As you know, she's been
brainwashed by the evil Stefano --

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Elle takes a practice LSAT exam as Serena, Margot and a few
other Delta Gammas do their butt-crunches in the Delta Gamma
living room.

Serena, while clenching her tush, hits a stop watch and Elle
starts writing furiously.

DISSOLVE TO:

Margot is now on all-fours, doing donkey kicks as she grades
Elle's practice exam. She writes "143" on top and holds it
up to Elle.

Elle slumps with frustration.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

ON VIDEO, Elle is rollerblading in shorts and a tank top.

ELLE
(to the camera)
And the laws and bi-laws of civil
obedience are crucial to my life --

Serena skates by and fake-elbows Elle.

ELLE
(calling after her)
No shoving on the skate path! City
ordinance 22G!

INT. LIBRARY STUDY ROOM - NIGHT

Elle sits in front of Amy, as Amy quizzes her with practice
LSAT questions. Books are piled high around them.

Elle gazes out the window to see -- Warner and some
BARECHESTED FRATERNITY BOYS carrying a keg across the quad.
Her eyes light up and she looks at Amy pleadingly. Amy shakes
her head no. Elle slumps, then rises and goes to the window,
closing the shades and getting back to work.

EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY

ON VIDEO, Elle addresses the camera.

ELLE
I feel confident using legal jargon
in daily life.

CUT TO:

ON VIDEO, Elle walks across campus with Underdog in her purse,
feigning staged innocence. A RANDOM FRAT BOY pinches her
butt. She slaps his hand, dramatically.

ELLE
I object!

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

"LSAT EXAM - Sections 1-6" is scrawled on the chalk board.
Elle sits in an auditorium with about 90 other students,
LSAT booklet open, filling in answers. Concentrating so hard
she's practically getting a forehead wrinkle.

INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY

ON VIDEO, Elle speaks to the camera.

ELLE
(to the camera)
I've seen every episode of "The
Practice" and I'm even on speaking
terms with Dylan McDermott.

CUT TO:

EXT. DYLAN MCDERMOTT'S HOUSE - DAY

Dylan McDermott gets into his car and pulls out of his
driveway.

VIDEOTAPING MADLY, the girls follow in Elle's Boxster.

SERENA
There he is!

MARGOT
Pull up next to him!

Elle swerves around to pull up next to Dylan McDermott. They
scream at him as Serena videotapes.

ELLE
Dylan! We love you!

Dylan McDermott burns rubber as he flees.

EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY

ON VIDEO, Elle jogs while she addresses the camera.

ELLE
(To camera)
I'm totally focused and goal-oriented.
Plus I'm able to sway people with my
very convincing arguments.

She turns to Serena, jogging next to her.

ELLE
Calvin Klein's spring line is
atrocious. Don't you agree?

SERENA
(convinced)
Absolutely!

INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

Amy rushes in with a stack of mail, waving an LSAT envelope
as she calls out.

AMY
It's here!

Elle rushes down the stairs as the other Delta Gammas gather
around. Elle takes the envelope and says a quick prayer.

ELLE
One seventy-five... one seventy-
five...

She opens it and stares at it for a long moment. Then turns
it to the crowd and raises it above her head in triumph. The
girls immediately begin jumping up and down as group joy
ensues. Underdog yips with pride. The MONTAGE ENDS.

INT. HARVARD LAW ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY

ON THE TV, Elle stands up in the Jacuzzi.

ELLE
(on TV)
And that's why you should vote for
me. Elle Woods. Future lawyer. For
the Class of 2003.

The video is PAUSED, as three ADMISSIONS GUYS in their 4.0's
sit at a table piled high with applications, the DEAN OF
ADMISSIONS at the head of it. STUNNED SILENCE fills the room.

Finally one of them speaks.

ADMISSIONS GUY #1
That was certainly a very --
(adjusting himself)
Imaginative essay.

ADMISSIONS GUY #2
(to the Dean)
She does have a 4.0 from USC and she
got a one-seventy-nine on her LSATs.

DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
A fashion major?

ADMISSIONS GUY #3
Well, we've never had one before...
aren't we always looking for
diversity?

AMISSIONS GUY #1
Her list of extracurriculars is
impressive.

The Dean looks at her application.

DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
(unimpressed)
She was in a Ricky Martin video --

ADMISSIONS GUY #2
Clearly, she's interested in music...

DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
(reading on; skeptical)
She also designed a line of faux fur
panties for her sorority's charity
project --

ADMISSIONS GUY #3
Then she's a friend to animals as
well as a philanthropist.

ADMISSIONS GUY #1
I think it's obvious that she's a
very well-rounded individual.

He points to Elle -- freeze-framed in her bikini-top on video,
on the TV. The admissions guys look to the Dean. He folds.

DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
Elle Woods -- Welcome to Harvard.

EXT. WOODS' BACKYARD - DAY

Elle's parents -- DANIEL, in tennis clothes, and the
facelifted SAPPHIRE -- stare at Elle over juice by the pool.

DANIEL
(frowning)
Law school?

Sapphire puts a hand to her throat in distress. Elle is
confused.

ELLE
It's a perfectly respectable place...

DANIEL
Sweetheart, you don't need law school.
Law school is for people who are
boring and ugly and serious. And
you, button, are none of those things.

Sapphire is in agreement.

SAPPHIRE
You were first runner-up in the Miss
Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw
all that away?

ELLE
Because this is what I want. I've
worked hard for it. Don't you
understand that this is important to
me?

She looks at her uncomprehending parents.

ELLE
Going to Harvard is the only way I
can get the love of my life back!

Sapphire looks at her, still not getting it.

SAPPHIRE
Can't you just suck his wiener?
(TV VERSION)
Can't you just get your nose done?

Elle reacts to her mother's skewed logic.

EXT. HARVARD DORM - DAY

Pale, studious LAW STUDENTS clad in earth tones, move into
their dorm, carrying in their spartan belongings (coffee
makers, books, computers). In the distance, a HAPPY POP SONG
(perhaps "Heaven Tonight by Hole) is heard. As it gets louder,
heads turn to see -- A silver, convertible Boxster driving
up, Elle at the wheel, MUSIC BLASTING. A large MOVING VAN
follows the Boxster.

People lean out of their windows, buzzing with interest as --

Elle's car stops in front of the dorm. She hops out, scooping
up Underdog and looking every inch the LA-Fred-Segal glamour-
queen, as she looks around with a smile.

Elle looks at Underdog.

ELLE
We're here!

She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy
dish, inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing
BESPECTACLED BOY (several yards away).

He trips, dropping his I-MAC. It shatters into a million
pieces.

Not noticing, Elle stands and turns to two MOVING GUYS who
are hauling a pink, faux-fur love seat and a potted palm
tree out of the truck.

ELLE
This way, guys!

With a beauty queen smile in place, she strides into the
dorm as the other students watch in amazement.

HANGING OUT OF THE WINDOW

ARROGANT AARON, a Mensa geek with attitude, turns to his
roommate.

ARROGANT AARON
Whose knob did she honk to get in
here?

EXT. LAW SCHOOL QUAD - DAY

"Welcome Law Students Class of 2003" banners hang over
orientation tables manned by second year law students (2L's)
wearing red t-shirts. Club tables with banners that read
"Harvard Law Journal" and "Environmental Law Association"
are set up nearby.

Elle takes a packet from a fuzzy MALE 2L.

FUZZY 2L
Class schedule, map, book list.

ELLE
Has Warner Huntington checked in
yet?

FUZZY 2L
(checking)
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the
Lido deck.

She frowns and starts to move on, but then looks through the
packet with a frown and turns back.

ELLE
Wait -- my social events schedule is
missing.

FUZZY 2L
Your what?

ELLE
You know -- mixers, formals, beach
trips.

FUZZY 2L
(deadpan)
There's a pizza welcome lunch in
twenty minutes. Does that count?

ELLE
(wrinkling her nose)
I guess it'll have to...

The Fuzzy Guy looks at the red-shirted BALD 2L next to him,
as Elle walks off.

FUZZY 2L
What the hell was that?

BALD 2L
(watching her go)
Malibu Barbie lives.

EXT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - OUTDOOR GARDEN - DAY

Elle sits at the outdoor table, ignoring her slice of pizza,
as she looks around for Warner. Not finding him, she turns
her attention to the Group Leader, a BURNED OUT 2L in a red
t-shirt.

BURNED OUT 2L
Okay. Welcome to law school. This is
the part where we go around in a
circle and everyone says a little
bit about themselves. Let's start
with you.

He gestures at a guy with glasses, DORKY DAVID.

DORKY DAVID
I have a Masters in Russian
Literature, a Ph.D in Biochemistry,
and for the last eighteen months,
I've been de-worming orphans in
Somalia.

BURNED OUT 2L
Awesome. How about you, Enid?

ENID, a militant feminista, looks up.

ENID
Ph.D from Berkeley in Women's Studies --
emphasis in the History of Combat.
And last year, I led the march for
Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.

BURNED OUT 2L
Killer.

He looks at an intense guy in his late twenties, IVAN.

INTENSE IVAN
I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked
on Wall Street for four years, mushed
in three ididarods and I've figured
out how to crash the stock market in
Sri Lanka if any of you want to get
together later.

BURNED OUT 2L
Sweet. What about you?

He looks at Elle. She sits up straight.

ELLE
I'm a Gemini. I have a Bachelors
degree from USC, where I was Sigma
Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta
Gamma, and last year -- I was
Homecoming Queen.

She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting.

ELLE
Oh!
(dramatically)
Two weeks ago, I saw Cameron Diaz at
Fred Segal -- and talked her out of
buying a truly heinous angora sweater!
Whoever said that orange is the new
pink is seriously disturbed.

She looks around, pleased. Enid' snickers as the rest of the
group stares at Elle, dumbfounded.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY

A grey, dingy, cell-block style room -- now crammed with
Elle's clothes, the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm,
along with an Elliptical Cross-Trainer, pink flamingo party
lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture.

Elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny Prada
backpack to no avail. She gives up and tosses the book onto
the bed where Underdog leaps away to miss being squished.

ELLE
Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first
class as a serious law student.

She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate
skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy,
wire-rimmed glasses.

ELLE
(to herself)
I totally look the part!

INT. LAW SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Elle heads for a classroom, amidst a crowd of students who
eye her like she's an alien. She rounds a corner, seeing --

WARNER, in all his handsome glory, looking over his schedule.

She starts toward him, as if pulled by a magnetic force.

Arrogant Aaron sees her passing by.

ARROGANT AARON
(seductively)
Hello there...

Elle keeps going, not even noticing him. Eyes only for Warner.
Arrogant Aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived blow-
off.

As Elle gets closer to Warner, she opts for wandering past
him, seemingly oblivious to his presence.

WARNER
(stunned)
Elle?!

Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant.

ELLE
Warner?! Oh my God, I completely
forgot you were going here!

He looks at her, confused. People walk by, staring.

WARNER
What're you talking about? You're
not here to see me?

ELLE
No, silly. I go here.

WARNER
(still confused)
You go where?

ELLE
Harvard. Law school.

WARNER
You got into Harvard Law?

ELLE
(confused at his
confusion)
What, like it's that hard?

Warner stares at her -- completely discombobulated. She smiles
sweetly and makes a show of checking her watch.

ELLE
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after?
On the benches?

WARNER
Uh -- sure.

She sashays off with a confident smile.

INT. CIVIL PROCEDURES CLASS - DAY

Students file in and take their seats. Elle enters, looking
around nervously at the imposing auditorium. Arrogant Aaron,
next to her, leans over.

ARROGANT AARON
If you're looking for the best seat,
I hear the front row is the place to
be.

Elle smiles at him.

ELLE
Thanks.

INT. CIVIL PROCEDURES CLASS - DAY - LATER

PROFESSOR ELSPETH STROMWELL, a tough-as-nails Grande Dame in
her 50's , addresses the class. Laptops abound -- except for
Elle, who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink
plastic heart on the end.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
A legal education means you will
learn to speak in a new language.
You will be taught to achieve insight
into the world around you, and to
sharply question what you know.

Everyone soaks this up. Including Elle.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
The seat you've picked is yours for
the next nine months of your life.
Enjoy it. And those of you in the
front row, beware...

Elle, in the front row, between two UNSHOWERED BRANIACS,
looks around, panicked. One of the braniacs passes her the
seating chart and she has no choice but to sign her name.

In the back, Arrogant Aaron nudges his friend and smiles.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
"The law is reason free from passion."
Does anyone know who spoke those
immortal words?

Dorky David raises his hand.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Yes?

DORKY DAVID
(confidently)
Aristotle.

Professor Stromwell approaches him the way Cruella de Ville
approaches a puppy.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Are you sure?

Now he's not.

DORKY DAVID
Yes?

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Would you be willing to stake your
life on it?

DORKY DAVID
I think so...

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
How about --

She spins around, roughly POKING another student in the head.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
-- his life?

DORKY DAVID
(scared)
I don't know.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Well, I recommend knowing before
speaking. The law leaves much room
for interpretation -- but very little
for self-doubt.

As she turns away --

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
And you were right. It was Aristotle.

The class half-laughs in relief.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
I assume you've all read pages 1-48
and are now well-versed in subject
matter jurisdiction.

Elle looks around, surprised, as students open their books.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Who can tell us about Gordon v.
Steele?

Silence. Stromwell looks down at the seating chart.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Ivan Greenstein?

Intense Ivan straightens in his seat.

IVAN
Gordon sued her doctors for
malpractice.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
And what did the dispute entail?
(looking at her chart)
Let's call on someone in the hot
zone. Elle Woods?

Elle looks up, distressed.

ELLE
Uh... I wasn't aware that we had an
assignment.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
(looking at her chart)
Sarah Knottingham?

SARAH KNOTTINGHAM -- a prim and preppy blue-blood brunette,
dressed in pearls and a sweater set -- looks up.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Do you think it's acceptable that
Ms. Woods is unprepared?

Sarah looks over at Elle. Elle gives her a mortified smile.

Sarah turns back to Professor Stromwell.

SARAH
No, I don't.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Would you support my decision to ask
her to leave and return to class
only when she is prepared?

SARAH
Absolutely.

Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. Having
no choice, she gathers her purse and goes, completely
humiliated. Professor Stromwell returns to the matter at
hand.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Now, Ms. Knottingham, did diversity
jurisdiction exist in this case?

EXT. LAW SCHOOL QUAD - BENCHES - DAY - LATER

EMMETT -- a shy and quirkily handsome 28-year-old who could
pass for younger -- sits on a bench, going over some papers.

He looks up and spots Elle -- sitting across from him --
looking traumatized.

EMMETT
Are you okay?

Elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor.

ELLE
Do they just -- put you on the spot
like that? Like, all the time?

EMMETT
The professors? Yeah, they tend to
do that. Socratic method.

ELLE
And if you don't know the answer,
they just kick you out?

He smiles.

EMMETT
You have Stromwell.

ELLE
(hopeful)
Did she do that to you, too?

EMMETT
No, but she made me cry once. Not in
class -- I waited until I got to my
room, but yeah, she can pretty much
shrivel your balls -- or you know,
your whatevers.

ELLE
(stricken)
Neat.

EMMETT
Don't worry. It gets better. Who
else do you have?

Elle looks at her schedule.

ELLE
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.

EMMETT
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes
people with an opinion. Sit in the
back for Royalton. He tends to spit
when he talks about products
liability.

Elle makes a face. He smiles. Liking her.

EMMETT
And make sure you read the footnotes
in Levinson's class. That's where
all her exam questions come from.

ELLE
Wow. I'm glad I met you.

She smiles at him, grateful.

EMMETT
Oh, and getting one of Stromwell's
daily quotes right is almost as
important as acing the mid-term. But
you didn't hear it from me.

Students trickle out of the building.

ELLE
Are you a third-year?

Warner walks up, behind Emmett, interrupting.

WARNER
Hey.

Elle looks up, pure adoration on her face.

ELLE
Hi!

Emmett rises and walks off.

EMMETT
Good luck.

ELLE
(calling after him)
Thanks again for your help!

Warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with
her presence here.

WARNER
So -- uh -- how was your first class?

ELLE
Fine. Except for this horrible girl
who made me look bad in front of my
Civ Pro professor. But no biggie.
You're here now.
(perky)
How was your summer?

She pats the bench beside her. He doesn't move.

WARNER
(distracted)
Good. Good.

ELLE
Do anything exciting?

A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind.

Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his
side, presenting her.

WARNER
(nervous)
Urn, hey, have you met Sarah?

Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle,
full of contempt.

SARAH
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.

ELLE
(to Warner; horrified)
You know her?

WARNER
She's --

Sarah jumps in.

SARAH
-- I'm his fiancee.

Elle stares at her. Sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown
hair behind her ear and there it is -- The Rock.

ELLE
(in disbelief)
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.

WARNER
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep
school. We got back together over
the summer at my grandmother's
birthday party.

Elle looks stricken. Sarah gives her a smug smile.

SARAH
Warner told me all about you. You're
famous at our Club. She says it in a
way that is anything but flattering.
In fact, it's completely
condescending.

SARAH
(pointedly)
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

WARNER
I didn't know --

Elle looks from Warner to Sarah.

ELLE
Excuse me.

She rushes off. Sarah watches her go, a smug grin on her
face.

SARAH
(to Warner)
I thought you said she was pretty.

EXT. STREET/INT. ELLE'S CONVERTIBLE BOXSTER - DAY

Elle drives, wiping the tears from her face. She spots
something off to the side and SWERVES her car toward it, a
gasp of hope escaping her lips.

Her car stops in front of a strip mall salon called "Beauty
Oasis".

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY

A downscale, blue-collar salon, with five hair chairs and
two manicure stations. Old ladies and young waitresses get
perms. PAULETTE -- early 40s, lower-middle class, hard-edged,
plus-sized -- looks up as a defeated Elle sinks into the
manicure chair.(The manicure station is plastered with
pictures of RUFUS, a big, slobbering pit-bull).

PAULETTE
Bad day?

Elle holds out her hands. Paulette dips them into a dish of
soapy water.

ELLE
You can't even imagine.

PAULETTE
Spill.

Elle lets it all out in a rush.

ELLE
I worked really hard to get into law
school -- I blew off Spring Break
and Greek Week to study for the LSATs,
I completely neglected my Homecoming
Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to
direct my admissions video -- all so
I could get my boyfriend Warner back
and now he's engaged to this awful
girl Sarah so it was all for nothing!
I wish I'd never even come to Harvard.

Paulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing.

PAULETTE
After you went to all that trouble?

ELLE
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's
engaged! She's got the family six-
carat on her bony, unpolished finger.

PAULETTE
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm
with my guy eight years and then one
day it's "I met someone else. Move
out."

ELLE
(Horrified)
What'd you do?

PAULETTE
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds.
Dewey kept the trailer and my precious
baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.

She looks at a picture of the pit-bull.

PAULETTE
(Re the dog)
I didn't even get to go to his
birthday party.

ELLE
No!

PAULETTE
What could I do?
(shrugging)
He's a man who followed his pecker
to greener pastures. I'm a middle-
aged high-school dropout with stretch
marks and a fat ass. Happens every
day. At least to women like me.

ELLE
That's terrible!

PAULETTE
So, what's this Sarah got that you
don't? Three tits?

ELLE
She's from Connecticut. She belongs
to his stupid country club.

PAULETTE
Is she as pretty as you?

Elle looks down.

ELLE
(embarrassed)
I'm not pretty -- I'm genetically
blessed.

Paulette rolls her eyes, shaking her bottle of polish and
starting on Elle's right hand.

PAULETTE
Is she?

ELLE
She could use some mascara and some
serious highlights, but she's not
completely unfortunate-looking.

UPS GUY (O.S.)
Hello, ladies.

Paulette looks up to see the UPS GUY, a strapping hunk of a
man in his late 30's. She blushes and smooths down her hair,
knocking over a bottle of nail polish in the process. Trying
to play it off as she signs for the package.

UPS GUY
See ya later.

He goes. Paulette watches him. Elle notices.

PAULETTE
(hating herself)
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?
(Beat)
So you're sure, this Warner guy is
"the one"?

ELLE
Definitely! I love him!

Paulette looks at her.

PAULETTE
If a girl like you can't hold on to
her man -- then there sure as hell
isn't any hope for the rest of us.
What're you waiting for? Steal the
bastard back.

INT. DORMITORY - WARNER'S ROOM - DAY

Elle knocks on Warner's door, bottle of wine and two glasses
in hand.

ELLE
Warner?

When she gets no answer, she write a message on his memo
board --

CLOSE ON - "Call me! Love, You Know Who".

She leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes.

EXT. HARVARD LAW CAMPUS - DAY

Elle is in her push-up bikini, reclining in her beach chair,
pink frozen margarita in one hand, Underdog in the other,
law book in her lap, pretending to study.

We PULL BACK to reveal that she's sitting on the sidelines
of a touch-football game that Warner is playing with a group
of other 1-L's. Warner scores easily because the other male
eyes are all on Elle. He shakes his head and smiles.

INT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY

Elle sits, glaring at Sarah, who keeps waving her "The Rock"
in Elle's direction, as she plays footsie with Warner.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN -- 40s, a big fan of himself, salt and
pepper hair, no time for bullshit -- stands before the class.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
I should warn you that in addition
to competing against each other for
the top grade in this class, you'll
also be competing for one of my firm's
highly coveted four internship spots
next year where you will get to assist
on actual cases. Let the bloodbath
begin. Now, let's commence with our
usual torture --

He looks around.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Ms. Woods --

Sarah and her bitchy, clone-like friend CLAIRE exchange
knowing glances.

SARAH
This should be amusing.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Would you rather have a client who
committed a crime malum in se or
malum prohibitum?

ELLE
Neither.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Why not?

ELLE
I'd rather have a client who's
innocent.

Elle smiles, proud of her answer. The class snickers. Warner
frowns.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms.
Knottingham? Which would you prefer?

SARAH
Malum prohibitum. Because the client
would've committed a regulatory
infraction as opposed to a dangerous
crime.

Elle raises her hand.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Yes? Ms. Woods?

ELLE
I changed my mind. I'd pick the
dangerous one.

She looks pointedly at Sarah.

ELLE
I'm not afraid of a challenge.

Sarah glares back at her. Warner looks between the two of
them, worried.

INT. STUDY LOUNGE - DAY

The Harvard Public Interest Law Association meeting is
underway. Warner listens intently, A few seats away, Elle
appears to be taking notes.

CLOSE ON — her "notes" -- "I'm free for dinner tonight. Meet
me at The Cask & Flagon at 8." She folds the note and sticks
it in Underdog's mouth, then points him toward Warner.
Humiliated but dutiful, Underdog bounds off.

CLOSE ON - Underdog, as he carries forth his mission, arriving
at Warner's feet.

UNDERDOG'S POV - Warner discreetly takes the note from him,
then looks over at Elle, who feigns interest in the meeting.

INT. CASK & FLAGON RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Elle waits for Warner, alone at a table. Checking her watch
to see it's 8:45, she tries not to be sad.

INT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - DAY

Warner and his study group, Sarah and Claire included, sit
at a table, going over their outlines. Elle walks up to the
table, holding a basket of muffins, bright smile on her face.

ELLE
I'm here to join your study group.
And look! I brought sustenance!

She holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all
around.

WARNER
(nervously looking at
Sarah)
Elle, what're you doing here?

Elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a
muffin.

ELLE
Who's first?

She sits down next to Warner.

SARAH
Our group is full.

ELLE
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

CLAIRE
No, it's like a smart people thing.
And like Sarah said, we're full.

WARNER
Come on, we can make room for one
more.

Sarah looks at Warner with evil eyes.

SARAH
We've already assigned the outlines,
and everyone has started theirs.

CLAIRE
(to Warner)
Besides, you wouldn't let the fat
guy join.

WARNER
He tried to watch me take a shower!

Sarah looks at Elle.

SARAH
The answer is no.

Warner looks at her, feeling guilty. He shrugs an "I'm sorry",
but Elle's perkiness has gone.

She gathers up her muffins and stands, clutching the basket
to her chest as she goes.

ELLE
Then I guess I'll leave you alone.

She walks away, completely deflated, passing by the RAGING
FEMINIST STUDY GROUP. Enid calls out.

ENID
Maybe there's a sorority you could
join instead.

Elle stops and looks at her.

ELLE
(to Enid)
You know, if you'd come to a Rush
party, I would've at least been nice
to you.

ENID
Before you voted against me and called
me a dyke behind my back?

ELLE
I don't use that word. Only mean
people use that word. You must've
heard it from Sarah.

She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does,
she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY
DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands
there, even more depressed.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY - LATER

Elle sinks down onto her bed, deflated. She picks up the
phone and dials.

INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

Serena, with a new hairdo, and Margot are surrounded by
wedding dresses. Margot talks on her cell phone.

We INTERCUT.

MARGOT
(to Serena)
It's Elle!
(into phone)
Guess what I'm doing right this
second?

ELLE
Power yoga?

MARGOT
Picking out my wedding dress!

ELLE
What?!

MARGOT
Josh proposed!

ELLE
(startled)
No way --

Serena grabs the phone.

SERENA
(into phone)
So, you have The Rock yet?

Elle lies.

ELLE
Almost.

SERENA
Well, hurry up so you can come home!
We miss you!

ELLE
I miss you guys! The people here are
so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to
me unless it's to say something that's
not nice. Law school sucks!

SERENA
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to
tell you!

ELLE
What?

SERENA
I got bangs!

ELLE
(hurt and annoyed)
Really --

Margot grabs the phone back.

MARGOT
(into phone)
Keep June first open -- you're one
of my bridesmaids. And give Warner
our love.

ELLE
I will...

Margot hangs up and Elle follows suit. Even more deflated.

INT. ELLE'S DORM - HALLWAY - DAY - SAME TIME

Sarah and Claire walk past Elle's room, the door of which is
ajar.

SARAH
It's not just any Halloween party.
It's a "Come as Your Favorite
Defendant" party.

CLAIRE
That's genius.

Elle pops her head out of the room.

ELLE
(excited)
No way! Someone at this school is
actually having a party?

Sarah and Claire turn around. Elle's face falls when she
sees that it's them.

SARAH
No.

CLAIRE
You must've heard us wrong.

SARAH
Sorry. Looks like you'll be staying
home tonight. Alone.

They continue on as Elle goes back into her room, snubbed.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Elle shuts the door behind her and looks at Underdog.

ELLE
I can't believe this. Not only do I
not have Warner, but I'm unpopular!

The realization hits her hard. Underdog barks. She looks at
him.

ELLE
But I wasn't invited.

He barks again.

ELLE
You really think I should?

EXT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

Two feet in high heels and fishnet hose stride purposefully
up the sidewalk.

A perfect butt wearing a bunny tail wiggles up the steps.

INT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

A party filled with people who are no fun to party with.

NAMETAGS denote which famous defendant everyone is dressed
as.

Menenedez's, Tonya Harding's, and Buttafuco's pepper the
room.

Elle, decked out in a Playboy Bunny costume -- looking sexy
as hell -- strides in. People roll their eyes and ignore
her. Elle continues on.

NEARBY -- Enid, dressed as Lizzie Borden, axe in hand is in
the midst of a tirade against some guy dressed like William
Kennedy Smith.

ENID
The English language is all about
subliminal domination. Take the word
"semester". It's a perfect example
of this school's discriminatory
preference of semen to ovaries. That's
why I'm petitioning to have next
term be referred to as Winter Ovester.

The guy backs up in fright. As Elle passes, Enid looks over.

ENID
Hey, Elle -- I've been meaning to
ask you
(re her boobs)
-- are those real?

Elle snorts.

ELLE
Enid, please -- silicone is so 90's.

She keeps walking.

INT. INTO THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Sarah -- dressed as Hester Prynne -- and Claire -- as Joan
of Arc -- sip wine.

ELLE
(sarcastic)
Thanks for inviting me, girls. This
party is super fun.

They roll their eyes, checking out her Bunny costume.

SARAH
You're supposed to be dressed as a
famous defendant.

Elle smiles at Sarah.

ELLE
I am. Didn't you hear about the
Playboy Bunny who slit her ex-
boyfriend's new fiancee's throat
with a broken wine glass? It was
tragic.

She grabs a glass of wine and moves on.

EXT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Elle walks onto the back porch and finds Warner -- dressed
as O.J. in a USC football uniform, number 32, with a ball
and chain on his foot.

ELLE
Hey, O.J.

Warner turns. He looks around for Sarah. Not seeing her, he
smiles at Elle, admiring her costume.

WARNER
Wow. You're a walking felony.

ELLE
Thank you. Having fun?

WARNER
(checking her out)
Now I am.

ELLE
(flirty)
I feel like we've barely spent any
time together since we got here.

WARNER
That's because I spend all my time
with case studies and hypos.

ELLE
Tell me about it. I can't imagine
doing all this and Donovan's
internship next year.

WARNER
(scoffing)
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll
get the grades to qualify for one of
those spots. You're not smart enough.

She can't believe he's saying this. He realizes he's gone
too far, and back-pedals.

WARNER
I didn't mean --

ELLE
(cutting him off)
Am I on glue, or did I not get into
the same law school you did, Warner?

WARNER
(covering)
Well, yeah, but --

ELLE
But what? We took the same LSAT, we
take the same classes --

WARNER
I just don't want to see you get
your hopes up. You know how you get.

She stares at him. Realizing the awful truth.

ELLE
I'll never be good enough for you,
will I?

When he doesn't answer, she walks back into the house.

INT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

A group of tipsy 1Ls stand around. One of them holds a salad
bowl filled with cash.

ENID
I give her two more weeks.

She throws a twenty into the bowl.

DORKY DAVID
Two and a half?

He throws in his twenty as well.

SARAH
If she spreads her legs, maybe --

ARROGANT AARON
(adjusting his crotch)
Only if I'm feeling generous.

ELLE (O.S.)
What is this?

They turn around to find Elle standing there.

CLAIRE
We're betting on how much longer
you're going to last.

ELLE
(stung)
What?

SARAH
Look around, Elle. Do you actually
think you belong here?

They all stare at her.

ELLE
(hurt)
Why wouldn't I?

ENID
Because the rest of us provide some
worthwhile value to society?

ARROGANT AARON
Hold on, now -- every society needs
a bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep
with after we get rich?

Elle looks like she's been slapped. The others laugh at
Aaron's esteemed wit.

ELLE
You know what? All of you can just
kiss my ass.

She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and
anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room.

ELLE
(to herself)
You're about to see just how valuable
Elle Woods can be.

She stomps out of the house.

A GIRL-POWER SONG STARTS TO PLAY AS A MONTAGE BEGINS:

INT. HARVARD BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

A hot pink laptop is yanked off the shelf.

CUT TO:

Elle, still in her Bunny suit, minus the tail, stands in
line, paying for the laptop. People gape at her, but she's
oblivious in her resolve.

EMMETT walks up behind her in line. He clears his throat,
trying not to look at her costume.

Elle turns, seeing him.

ELLE
Don't ask.

EMMETT
I wasn't gonna --

She marches off. Laptop in hand.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A pony-tailed Elle types a brief, coffee next to her.

Underdog sleeps nearby, belly-up. Legs twitching in a
nightmare. Typing furiously, Elle breaks a nail, then
struggles to forge on, despite her instinct to stop and repair
it.

INT. LAW LIBRARY - DAY

Elle -- arms full of books -- walks past the Warner/Sarah
study group. Sarah and Claire scowl at her, but Elle passes
with her head held high.

INT. STUDY LOUNGE - DAY

Enid is surrounded by study materials and notecards. When
she gets up to use the ladies' room, Elle casually walks
over and slips a notecard into the middle of Enid's stack.
Then quickly walks on.

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY

Paulette quizzes Elle from a law textbook as her nails dry.
As she waits for Elle's answer, Paulette showers Underdog
with kisses, showing him pictures of Rufus.

INT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY

Donovan is in the midst of a lecture. He points at Elle.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
And the purpose of "diminished
capacity" is?

She swallows nervously, then speaks.

ELLE
To negate mens rea?

Donovan nods affirmatively and continues. Elle hides a smile.

INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

Elle reaches for a book on a high shelf, but she's not tall
enough. She tries a running start and leaps for it. Still
missing it. FROM THE LEFT, she runs and leaps again, missing
again. FROM THE RIGHT, she runs and leaps again, missing
again. Dorky David walks up and sets down a step-stool at
her: feet. Now winded, she smiles her thanks, stepping up to
retrieve her book.

INT. STUDY LOUNGE - DAY

Enid flips through her notecards, memorizing, when she comes
upon a picture of a NAKED MAN. Oh, the horror. She throws it
down in disgust as if her eyes have been burned.

Looking around, Enid sees Elle smiling and waving at her
from across the room.

INT. LAW LIBRARY - DAY

Elle walks past Arrogant Aaron, as he sleeps at his study
cubicle, head back on the chair.

She stops, backs up, and waves her hand over his face. When
he doesn't stir, she takes a magic marker out of her knapsack
and leans over to write something on his forehead.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Elle works out on her Elliptical Crosstrainer as she listens
to a lecture tape and watches Court TV on mute.

LECTURER (V.O.)
"A failure to act can constitute the
actus reus for accomplice liability
if the defendant has the legal duty
to intervene, but fails to do so."

INT. LAW LIBRARY - DAY

Arrogant Aaron wakes up with a start, checks his watch, and
rushes off to class. Oblivious to his facial graffiti, which
we can't yet read.

INT. CIVIL PROCEDURES CLASS - DAY

Professor Stromwell is in front of the class.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
So you've filed a claim. Now what?

She looks over to see Elle sitting there, typing on her
laptop.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Ms. Woods?

ELLE
Don't you also need to have evidence?

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Meaning?

Everyone now stares at Elle.

'ELLE
Meaning you need -- reasonable belief
that your claim would have, like,
evidentiary support?

Stromwell is somewhat impressed, but doesn't show it.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
And what kind of evidentiary support
does this case require? Let's ask
Mr. Harriman, who clearly believes
that I might be hungry.

She looks up at Arrogant Aaron in the back row. Who
unknowingly has "Eat Me" written on his forehead. He looks
back at her, confused, as the students around him snicker.

EXT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT

A "Closed" sign is on the door.

THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Elle and Paulette sitting in the
empty salon, laughing and clinking cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon
as they toast Elle's small victory.

We PULL BACK, leaving them laughing, as the MONTAGE ENDS.

INT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY

"THE STATE V. LATIMER" is written on the board. A ponytailed,
less made-up Elle takes notes on her lap-top, as Warner makes
an argument.

WARNER
According to Swinney v. Neubert,
Swinney, who was also a private sperm
donor, was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms with the
hours set forth by the parents. So,
if we're sticking to past precedent,
Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking -- he
was clearly within his rights to ask
for visitation.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
But Swinney was a one-time sperm
donor, and in our case, the defendant
was a habitual sperm donor, who also
happens to be harassing the parents
in his quest for visitation.

WARNER
But, without this man's sperm -- the
child in question would not exist.

He grins and looks around as the class murmurs their
agreement.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

EMMETT enters from the back, holding a file. He stands there
quietly, watching. Elle tentatively raises her hand.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Ms. Woods?

Sarah looks at Claire.

SARAH
(sotto)
The idiot speaks.

ELLE
Although Mr. Huntington makes an
excellent point, I have to wonder if
the defendant kept a thorough record
of each sperm emission made throughout
his life?

The class titters. Elle grows annoyed.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
(bemused)
Why do you ask?

Elle's hesitancy is replaced by conviction.

ELLE
Well, unless the defendant attempted
to contact every single one-night-
stand to determine if a child resulted
in those unions -- then he has no
parental claim whatsoever over this
child. Why this sperm? Why now?

Emmett's mouth twitches into a smile.

ELLE
For that matter, all masturbatory
emissions where his sperm was clearly
not seeking an egg could be termed
reckless abandonment.

Warner's mouth hangs open. As does Sarah's and the rest of
the class. Donovan smiles.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
I believe you've just won your case.

Elle grins.

INT. DONOVAN'S CLASS - LATER

As the students file out, Elle passes Donovan.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
You did well today.

She stops.

ELLE
I did?

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
You're applying for my internship,
aren't you?

ELLE
I don't know --

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
You should. Do you have a resume?

ELLE
(excited)
I do.

She pulls a resume out of her briefcase and hands it to him.

He looks at it.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
It's pink.

ELLE
And engraved... Gives it that extra
little something, doesn't it?
(smiling)
See you tomorrow!

She walks on. Emmett walks up, handing the file to Donovan.

EMMETT
I brought you the Windham notes.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
(watching Elle go)
You think she just woke up one morning
and said, "I think I'll go to law
school today!"?

Emmett looks after Elle, bemused.

EMMETT
Aside from that lapse in judgement --
she's got potential.

INT. ELLE'S CAR - DAY

Elle drives. Paulette is shotgun.

PAULETTE
You showed up Warner in class? You're
supposed to be showing up Sarah.

ELLE
I couldn't help it! It was the most
fun I've had since I've been in law
school. Not only was I good enough
for Warner -- I was better than him.
He has to see serious I am now. Even
Donovan was impressed, and he's a
total hard-ass.

Elle stops the car and turns off the ignition.

ELLE
You ready?

PAULETTE
No.

ELLE
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.

She points ahead of them. Paulette goes.

EXT. DEWEY'S TRAILER - DAY

The door opens. DEWEY (40s) and his beer gut emerge. Paulette
is on the porch. Trying to exude confidence, but failing.

DEWEY
(To Paulette)
What the hell do you want? We're
eating dinner.

PAULETTE
I just --

DEWEY
You just thought you'd come over and
show me what I'm definitely not
missing?

INT. ELLE'S CAR - DAY - SAME TIME

She watches, frowning.

EXT. DEWEY 'S TRAILER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Dewey's really having fun now.

DEWEY
What the hell happened to you? You
get a job at a donut shop?

PAULETTE
That's not what --

DEWEY
How many times you gonna show up
here, beggin' me to take you back?

Paulette reddens -- flustered and humiliated. Elle appears
next to her.

ELLE
Dewey Newcomb?

DEWEY
Who's askin'?

ELLE
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's
attorney.

Paulette looks at Elle in surprise, Elle keeps going.

ELLE
Under state law, you and Ms. Bonafante
had a common law marriage which
entitles her to the benefits of
property law and an equitable division
of assets.

Paulette watches Elle, mouth hanging open.

DEWEY
(Confused)
Come again?

ELLE
Due to the fact that you retained
the residence, Ms. Bonafante is
entitled to full ownership of the
canine property in question and we
will be enforcing said ownership
immediately.

DEWEY
Huh?

ELLE
Tell him, Paulette.

A still-stunned Paulette looks at Elle, then turns to Dewey,
fire in her ass.

PAULETTE
I'm taking the dog dumbass.
(calling into the
trailer)
C'mere, baby, Mommy's here!

Rufus bounds out, licking and kissing Paulette. The love
evident.

INT./EXT. ELLE'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Elle, Paulette and Rufus get in.

ELLE
We did it!

Elle high-fives her.

PAULETTE
God, that felt great!

ELLE
Look at him. He's still scratching
his head.

PAULETTE
Which must be a nice vacation for
his balls...

She turns to Rufus, hugging him.

PAULETTE
And now Mommy's got somebody to eat
dinner with again. You don't care
what Mommy's butt looks like, do
you?

Elle looks over at Paulette, heart going out to her.

INT. CIVIL PROCEDURES CLASS - DAY

Elle turns on her Powerbook as Professor Stromwell faces the
class with her morning quote.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
"An image and a good hook can get
you into a room -- but something has
to keep you in that room."

She looks around as hands are raised.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Mr. Greenstein?

INTENSE IVAN
Judge Sandra Day O'Connor?

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Close...

Intense Ivan's face falls. She looks around, seeing Elle
raising her hand.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Ms. Woods?

ELLE
Madonna?

The class rolls their eyes and laughs, watching Stromwell.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
Damn. Thought I'd get everyone on
that one.

The class can't believe Elle is right.

EXT. CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - HALLWAY - DAY

A THRONG of buzzing students is gathered around the bulletin
board. Elle walks up.

ELLE
What's going on?

DORKY DAVID
Donovan's firm is defending a major
murder case and his caseload is so
heavy he's taking on first year
interns.

ELLE
He chose them already?

Sarah, at the front of the throng, gasps, then turns to
Warner.

SARAH
We got it!

He grins and she kisses him on the cheek. Elle, shoved to
the back, tries to get closer, when she hears --

ENID
The competition must not have been
that stiff.

Arrogant Aaron pushes his way to the board.

ARROGANT AARON
Why? Enid got a spot?

ENID
Hey! Watch your hands, Mr. Grabass.

ARROGANT AARON
(ignoring her)
That only leaves one for --

Elle, now next to him, gets a look at the board.

ELLE
(shocked)
Me?!

Everyone REACTS. She turns and faces the throng. They stare
back at her in shock. Dignified, she walks through them as
they PART for her, stopping in front of Warner and Sarah.

ELLE
(to Warner)
Remember the time after Winter Formal?
When we spent four incredible hours
in the hot tub...?

Sarah looks away.

ELLE
This is way better than that.
(pushing Sarah aside)
Excuse me. I have some shopping to
do.

As she goes, surprised CHATTER overtakes the hallway.

INT. SAK'S - WOMENS' DEPT. - DAY

Elle scans the racks of conservative clothes. She holds up a
cashmere twinset and wrinkles her nose, but throws it over
her arm anyway.

INT. NORDSTROM'S - HANDBAGS - DAY - LATER

Elle admires a trendy handbag, but then promptly sets it
down and picks up a practical leather briefcase.

INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LOBBY - DAY

The elevator door opens and Warner and Elle emerge. Elle is
sporting her new, boring "lawyer" clothes. Warner is baffled
and impressed by her transformation.

WARNER
You look -- nice.

ELLE
Thank you.

She gives him an aloof smile and walks off. Warner watches
her go. Sarah stands in the lobby. None too happy to witness
this.

INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Donovan strides through the office, his four interns behind
him. He points as he walks.

DONOVAN
There's your office, there's the
bathroom, there's the coffee machine.
There's Gerard, Dick and Bobby.

GERARD, smarmy and trim, DICK, short and bald, and BOBBY,
black and bespectacled, wave as the interns pass by.

DONOVAN
They're the other associates on the
case. Ask them all your stupid
questions, save the smart ones for
me.

INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT AND DONOVAN - CONFERENCE ROOM

Professor Donovan opens his briefcase as Elle, Sarah, Enid
and Warner hang on his every word.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
We're defending Brooke Windham, whose
very wealthy husband was found shot
to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.

SARAH
Gold digger?

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
You'd think so, since the stiff was
sixty, but she was rich on her own.
Some kind of fitness empire. You can
buy her exercise tapes on
infomercials.

Elle frowns.

ELLE
Wait a minute -- are we talking about
Brooke Daniels?

Donovan checks his papers.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Maiden name -- Daniels.
(looking up)
You know her?

ELLE
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my
pledge class or anything -- she
graduated five years ahead of me.
But I used to take her class at the
LA Sports Club. She's amazing!

The others looks at each other and roll their eyes.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Amazing how?

ELLE
She could make you drop three pounds
in one class. She's completely gifted!

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Well, in all likelihood, she's
completely guilty as well. She was
seen standing over her husband's
dead body.

WARNER
By who?

SARAH
(correcting him)
Whom?

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
His twenty-seven year old daughter
and the pool boy.

ELLE
Maybe she found him like that.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
That's the story she'll be telling
the jury. We just have to prove it.

Emmett walks in and sits.

EMMETT
Sorry I'm late.

Elle looks at him, confused.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
This is Emmett Kerrigan, another
associate. Top three in his class
and former editor of Harvard Law
Review. You've probably seen him
lurking around campus doing my
research.

EMMETT
Or napping on the quad.

Elle smiles at him. He smiles back. Almost shy.

WARNER
(to Donovan)
What about the murder weapon?

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
The gun is missing. The coroner said
he'd been dead thirty minutes dead
when the cops arrived -- giving Brooke
plenty of time to stash it.

ELLE
There's no way Brooke could've done
this -- Exercise gives you endorphins,
endorphins make you happy -- happy
people don't kill their husbands!

Sarah and Enid snort.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
You don't really believe she's
innocent?

ELLE
Of course, I do!

Emmett looks at her.

EMMETT
Then we may actually have a case.

He looks over at Donovan, who's not so sure.

EXT. BOSTON JAIL - DAY

Grey and imposing.

INT. BOSTON JAIL - DAY

Donovan sits at a long table, next to BROOKE, a pretty 26-
year-old blonde with a perfect body and a sad face. The
interns and associates sit at the far end of the table taking
notes. A cop stands guard at the door.

DONOVAN
What alibi?

BROOKE
I can't tell you.

DONOVAN
You understand you're on trial for
murder?

BROOKE
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my
husband lying on the floor, bent
down to check his heart, screamed my
head off and Chutney and Enrique ran
inside.

DONOVAN
Where they saw you standing over the
body covered in his blood.

She glares at him.

BROOKE
Why would I kill my husband?

DONOVAN
Insurance? A love affair? Pure
unadulterated hatred? Believe me,
the DA will come up with plenty of
reasons.

BROOKE
I loved him!

DONOVAN
He was thirty-four years older than
you. That doesn't sound so good to a
jury.

Now she's pissed.

BROOKE
Then show them a picture of his cock.
They might put a few things together.

Everyone stiffens except for Elle, who laughs out loud.

DONOVAN
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is
gonna want an alibi.

BROOKE
I can't give you that. And if you
put me on the stand, I'll lie.

Donovan takes a moment to look at her like she's an idiot.

DONOVAN
Were you with another man?

BROOKE
Go to hell.

DONOVAN
I'll take that as a no.

BROOKE
Are we done for today?

DONOVAN
I believe we are.

He stands. As do his minions. As they file out, Brooke sees
Elle.

BROOKE
Hey -- I know you.

Elle perks up.

ELLE
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan
of yours!

BROOKE
You took my class in LA. You had the
best high kick I've ever seen. Are
you one of my lawyers?

ELLE
Sort of.

Brooke looks at Elle as if she's her savior.

BROOKE
Well, thank God one of you has a
brain.

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY

Rufus sleeps happily on the floor. Elle sits in front of
Paulette, nails in the soapy water.

ELLE
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's
in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm
the only one who believes her. Donovan
totally thinks she's guilty.

PAULETTE
That's because men are big, fat
retards who don't -- Oh, my God...

ON THE DOOR

The UPS GUY stands in the doorway with a package, sun
streaming in around him.

UPS GUY
Afternoon, ladies.

ON ELLE AND PAULETTE

PAULETTE
It's him!

Paulette smooths down her hair.

ELLE
It's who?

She turns to look as we go to --

BUTT-CAM -- CLOSE ON the crisp brown shorts of a regulation
UPS uniform, as they stretch across the taut, muscular
buttocks of UPS GUY, as he strides through the shop.

When the butt stops moving, we WIDEN to reveal the UPS Guy
now standing in front of Elle and Paulette.

UPS GUY
I've got a package.

Elle turns to Paulette, eyes wide.

ELLE
(agreeing)
He's got a package.

Paulette is frozen. Blushing and nervous.

UPS GUY
How ya doin' today?

PAULETTE
Fine?

He waits for her to sign. She remains frozen. Elle takes the
pen and signs for her, trying to help. UPS Guy smiles kindly
at Paulette and heads out.

UPS GUY
Take it easy.

Paulette watches him go, hand over her heart. Elle looks at
her, concerned.

ELLE
So, this is the only interaction you
two have ever had?

PAULETTE
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead
of "Fine".

ELLE
Have you ever considered asking him
if he'd like a cold beverage? Or
perhaps a neck massage?

PAULETTE
What's the point?
(matter of factly)
Look at me.

ELLE
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful,
fabulous, sexy woman.

Paulette snorts.

PAULETTE
Good one.

ELLE
Trust me. You've got the equipment,
you just need to read the manual.

Elle stands.

ELLE
I'm going to show you a little
maneuver my mother taught me when I
was in junior high. In my experience,
it has a 98% success rate in getting
a man's attention and when used
appropriately -- an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

The HAIRSTYLISTS and CLIENTS listen, intrigued.

ELLE
It's called the "Bend & Snap".
(acting)
"Oh, look! There's something on the
floor that I need to pick up!" Bend...

She slowly BENDS down, as if to pick up something, sticking
out her tush, knee cocked. She slides her hand down her cocked
leg until her hand touches the floor and she SNAPS back up,
boobs a'bouncing.

ELLE
And snap! Now you try.

Paulette stands up repeating the maneuver.

PAULETTE
Bend... and snap!

It's a spastic version of what Elle just did.

ELLE
Good. Now this time, put a little
arch in your back and maybe get your
footing more solid.

Paulette does it again. This time, getting it right.

ELLE
Perfect!

A HAIR CLIENT walks over, head full of curlers.

HAIR CLIENT
Like this?

She tries.

ELLE
Good.

She adjusts her like a yoga instructor would.

ELLE
But cock that knee.

ANOTHER CLIENT calls over.

ANOTHER CLIENT
Am I doing it right?

Elle walks over to her.

ELLE
More snap, less bend.

She turns to the rest of the clients.

ELLE
C'mon -- everyone try!

Clients hop up out of their chairs as someone reaches over
and cranks the transistor radio, blaring "BRICK HOUSE" by
the Commodores. All the clients and technicians, no matter
what their age, or how many foils are in there hair, are up
and doing the "Bend & Snap", repeating the mantra as they
do. Elle walks around them, continuing to adjust them.

ELLE
Now everyone together.

They all bend in unison -- going down on "Brick" --

EVERYONE
Bend --

And snapping back up -- on "House"

EVERYONE
And snap !

The frivolity continues as the roomful of ladies perfect the
maneuver. MAURICE, a male hair-dresser, comes out of the
back room, mixing a bowl of bleach as he walks. He stops
when he spots the activity.

MAURICE
Oh, my God! The Bend & Snap!
(to an old lady)
Works every time...

INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN-CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CHUTNEY, 27, curly-haired and bitter, sits in front of
Donovan, the FEMALE DA, the associates, the interns and a
court reporter, as she's interviewed.

CHUTNEY
I got out of the shower, walked
downstairs, saw her standing over my
father, and called the police.

DONOVAN
Did she have a weapon in her hand?

CHUTNEY
No.

DONOVAN
Was there any reason for you to
believe she had discarded a weapon?

CHUTNEY
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot
him.

DONOVAN
Was there any evidence that Mrs.
Windham shot him?

CHUTNEY
(duh)
His dead body with a bullet in it.

INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN-CONFERENCE ROOM-LATER

ENRIQUE, 25, Latino and hunky as hell, sits in the seat that
Chutney has vacated.

DONOVAN
What did you see when you entered
the house?

ENRIQUE
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the
body of Mr. Windham.

DONOVAN
Was she carrying a weapon?

ENRIQUE
No, she was crying her eyes out.

Donovan smiles.

DONOVAN
So she was distraught that her husband
was dead?

ENRIQUE
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most
sweet, wonderful woman I know. I
have loved her since the day she
hired me. She could never do something
this awful. I know this because we
are very close.

The others shift uncomfortably, then look at each other.
Then, back at Enrique and his shiny, unbuttoned-to-show-his-
pecs shirt. The DA smiles.

INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

Donovan, the interns, and associates sit at a large table.

GERARD
She's screwing the pool boy.

Elle gasps and makes a face.

ELLE
There is no way a Delta Gamma would
sleep with a man in a shiny shirt.
Warner, back me up here.

Warner shrugs, embarrassed. Sarah looks at Donovan.

SARAH
I hate to agree  but I don't see the
two of them actually --
(wrinkling her nose)
-- doing it.

ENID
Women like that will screw anything.

ELLE
So, because she's beautiful and has
a good body, she's easy? What book
of feminist theory did you read that
in, Enid?

Emmett jumps in before war breaks out.

EMMETT
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy,
who did?

ELLE
My money's on the angry daughter or
the ex-wife.

DONOVAN
Chutney has a trust fund. She didn't
need the insurance payoff or the
inheritance.

BOBBY
What about her mother?

DONOVAN
Covered. She was in Aspen at the
time. Ten people saw her downing
cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.

ELLE
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.

DONOVAN
That's touching, Elle, but we need
an alibi.

Elle thinks about this.

INT. BOSTON JAIL - LOBBY - DAY

A nervous Elle stands in front of the burly CHECK-IN GUARD.

She holds a basket of goodies.

ELLE
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.

GUARD
Licensed attorney or family member?

ELLE
Uh -- family.

GUARD
Relation?

ELLE
I'm her sister.

GUARD
Name?

ELLE
Delta. Gamma.

He makes a note and buzzes her in.

INT. BOSTON JAIL - DAY

Elle sits at a conference table with her basket. A door opens
and a female guard brings Brooke into the room. Wearing a
horribly tacky orange jumpsuit.

ELLE
Are you okay? You look so sad... and
so orange.

BROOKE
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.

ELLE
He means well. He's really brilliant
and all.

Brooke sits, not looking convinced.

BROOKE
He better be, for what I'm paying
him.

Elle pushes her basket forward.

ELLE
I brought you some necessities. Pink
sheets. Aromatherapy candles. Loofah.
And The Bible.

She holds up a "Cosmopolitan".

BROOKE
You're an angel.

Elle squirms in her seat.

ELLE
But I have to tell you the real reason
I'm here. Professor Donovan says we
really, really need your alibi.

Brooke tears up.

BROOKE
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.

ELLE
Who could better understand than me?

Brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink Ralph Lauren
sheets.

BROOKE
It's so shameful...

ELLE
Whatever it is -- it could save you.

BROOKE
That's just it -- it would ruin me!

ELLE
How?

Brooke composes herself. Takes a deep breath. Looks at Elle.

BROOKE
I have made my fortune on my ability
to teach women how to perfect their
bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster
workout.

ELLE
I know! You helped me go from a six
to a four!

Brooke starts to cry again.

BROOKE
On the day of Heyworth's murder, I
was --

She snorts back a sob.

BROOKE
-- getting liposuction.

Elle gasps.

ELLE
No!

BROOKE
(completely shamed)
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal
people can have this ass! If my fans
knew, I'd lose everything. I've
already lost my husband. I rather be
in jail then lose my reputation!

Elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her.

ELLE
Your secret is safe with me.

INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LIBRARY - DAY

The associates and interns sit at a table piled high with
research, as Donovan goes over his notes.

DONOVAN
We've got two interviews tomorrow
that Dick and Bobby are gonna handle,
and the ex-wife in an hour.

He looks up.

DONOVAN
Sarah, can you grab me some coffee?

Sarah rises, and fetches the coffee from the side table.

DONOVAN
And according to this communique
from the prison, our client apparently
had a visit from her sister? A Miss
Delta Gamma --

He looks at Elle.

DONOVAN
Anyone you know?

Elle looks up, caught. The others looks at her.

ELLE
I went to get her alibi.

Emmett looks over, surprised.

DONOVAN
Did you get it?

ELLE
Yes. But I can't tell you what it
is.

The others can't believe this.

DONOVAN
Why the hell not?

ELLE
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I
can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

Now he's pissed.

DONOVAN
Fuck sisterhood. This is a murder
trial, not some scandal at the
sorority house. I want the alibi.

Sarah sets Donovan's coffee down. Watching to see what Elle
will do.

ELLE
I can't give it to you. All I can
tell you is that she's innocent.

An ASSISTANT pokes her head in the room.

ASSISTANT
Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark
is on line two.

Donovan rises, still annoyed.

DONOVAN
Someone reason with her while I take
this.

He walks out. The others look at Elle.

BOBBY
Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.

ELLE
No!

DICK
We're gonna lose the case if you
don't.

ELLE
Then we're not very good lawyers.

Emmett hides a smile. Warner leans over to Elle. Sarah is
nearby, listening.

WARNER
(quietly)
If you tell him, you'll probably
make summer associate. Who cares
about Brooke? Think about yourself.

ELLE
I gave her my word, Warner.

Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different
light.

Donovan storms back in.

DONOVAN
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned
with the fact that her interview is
today. She's at a spa in the
Berkshires.

GERARD
A spa?
(to Elle)
Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship?

Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan.

ELLE
I can go if you want.

ENID
Why you?

GERARD
(to Enid)
Have you ever been to a spa?

ENID
And subscribe to the doctrine of
self-hatred imposed upon my gender
by male delusions of the way women
are supposed to look?
(beat)
Twice.

Donovan motions toward Elle. Then looks at Emmett with a
pointed "Get the alibi" look.

DONOVAN
Go with her.

INT. EMMETT'S VOLVO - DAY

Emmett drives, Elle is shotgun.

ELLE
Explain to me why you're so anti-
Brooke.

EMMETT
Uh, for starters, she won't give us
an alibi --

ELLE
Aside from that.

EMMETT
She's completely untrustworthy.

ELLE
Why?

EMMETT
She married an old man, she's made a
living on telling women they're too
fat, she hawks her crap on the Home
Shopping Network...

ELLE
A) He's an old man with a really big
penis. B) She never told me I was
fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells
on that network.

EMMETT
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding
something.

ELLE
But maybe it's not what you think.

EMMETT
But maybe it is --

They're quiet for a moment. She looks at him.

ELLE
You're kind of being a butt-head
right now.

EMMETT
(amused)
How do you figure?

ELLE
Because people aren't always what
they seem to be and you refuse to
see that. Have a little faith. You
might be surprised.

They're quiet again while he thinks about this. He looks
over at her.

EMMETT
I can't believe you called me a
butthead. No one's called me a butt-
head since ninth grade.

ELLE
Maybe not to your face...

She gives him a teasing smile. He smiles back at her, shaking
his head.

INT. SPA - LOBBY - DAY

Elle and Emmett are at the desk.

ELLE
We have two o'clock massages. Kerrigan
and Woods.

DESK CLERK
Go on back.

Elle starts to go, then stops.

ELLE
Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham
Vandermark is here somewhere and I'm
supposed to meet her for a Pilates
class. Do you have her schedule?

DESK CLERK
(checking)
She's in the mud room until four.

Elle smiles her thanks and walks off with Emmett.

EMMETT
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?

ELLE
No, she can't move for an hour.

She grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall.

INT. SPA - MUD ROOM - DAY

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK, late 40s, brunette, East Coast hoity-
toity -- lies on a table like a corpse, stiff with mud,
cucumbers over her eyes. Elle and Emmett poke their heads
in.

ELLE
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

EMMETT
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret
& Donovan --

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
So, you found me.

Emmett looks at Elle.

EMMETT
(sotto)
She's naked.

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian
mud -- hardly naked.

ELLE
(to Emmett)
I'll cover her -- parts.

Elle settles on three washcloths, strategically placed.

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
So, I hear the tart from California
shot Heyworth.

EMMETT
Well, that's what we're trying to
prove didn't happen. Do you have any
reason to believe it did?

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
I never met the woman, but from what
my daughter tells me, she's quite
the cun --

ELLE
(interrupting her)
She's not!

EMMETT
Did your daughter ever say anything
to you about Brooke and Heyworth's
relationship?

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
Aside from the fact that he found
her on an infomercial? She said they
humped like gorillas. Chutney could
hear them all the way in the pool
house.

EMMETT
I' m sure that was very awkward for
Chutney.
(sotto)
Much as it is for me, hearing you
tell about it.

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
But I guess it wasn't enough for
Brooke.

EMMETT
Why do you say that?

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?

ELLE
(uneasy)
Yes...

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
Like I said, I've never met Brooke,
but I have seen her from a distance.
When I'd come over to pick up the
alimony check that Heyworth forgot
to mail every month, she'd be out by
the pool, with Mr. Hot Pants hovering
over her with some pink drink.

EMMETT
Hovering?

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
I didn't stick around long enough to
watch him stick his swizzle stick in
her mouth, but I'd bet my next check
that that's where he was about to
put it.

INT. EMMETT'S VOLVO - DAY

Emmett drives, raving.

EMMETT
How can you still believe she's
innocent?

ELLE
You're going to trust the word of a
woman who named her child after a
condiment? She's ly-ing.

EMMETT
And you know this for a fact?

ELLE
Did you see the icky black color of
her hair?

EMMETT
So?

ELLE
I never trust a woman who's not
blonde. Except for my friend Serena,
but that's only because she's a blonde
at heart. That's the whole reason
I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense
Fund.

He looks at her and laughs.

EMMETT
The what?

ELLE
Blondes are discriminated against
worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and
people are saying she's sleeping
with the cheesy pool boy and shooting
her husband. If she was a mousy
brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor
widow."

EMMETT
You're serious?

She's fired up now.

ELLE
You should see the way I'm treated
in class! I'm a complete source of
mockery.

This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund is needed.

He goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm.

EMMETT
Okay, how would it work?

ELLE
It would be a full-service law firm,
by and for blondes, providing positive
blonde role models and community
outreach in high blonde areas. I
mean, think about it -- name one
blonde intellectual role model.

EMMETT
I can't.

ELLE
That is a direct result of anti-
blonde discrimination!

EMMETT
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.

ELLE
If she were a true blonde, she
would've left the cheating bastard.
Blondes don't let their husbands get
fellated by brunettes and live to
tell about it.

Emmett frowns.

EMMETT
In that case, maybe Heyworth got
fellated by a brunette and Brooke
caught him.

ELLE
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you
think a sixty-year-old man can take?

EMMETT
That's not really a topic that keeps
me up at night -- but maybe it should.

Elle digs in her purse.

ELLE
Speaking of that -- I bought you
some seaweed cream while we were at
the spa.

She hands it to him. He keeps his hands on the wheel, not
taking it.

EMMETT
What the hell is that for?

ELLE
The bags under your eyes. You're an
attractive man, but you need to take
better care of yourself.

EMMETT
I don't --
(gesturing to the
cream)
Do that stuff.

ELLE
Well, you should -- If you look good,
you feel good and if you feel good,
you project joy into the world.

EMMETT
Projecting joy is not my job.

ELLE
(sighing)
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.

She puts the cream back in her purse. They ride in silence
for a moment. Then --

EMMETT
You really think I'm attractive?

ELLE
For a butt-head? Yes.

She smiles at him.

EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - NIGHT

Elle walks down the sidewalk to her dorm, approaching Dorky
David as he tries to ask out a FRESHMAN GIRL who thinks she's
a lot cuter than she actually is. She stands with her freshman
friends.

DORKY DAVID
So -- I called your room last night.

FRESHMAN GIRL
(cold)
I heard.

DORKY DAVID
I was thinking maybe we could go out
sometime.

FRESHMAN GIRL
Uh, no... you're a dork.

Turns back to her FRIENDS who all laugh at him. Elle winces
as she passes.

DORKY DAVID
(hopeful)
I'm in law school --

The Freshman Girl turns back to him.

FRESHMAN GIRL
Look -- I'm not going out with you.
I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls
like me don't go out with losers
like you.

Her friends snicker. Elle stops at this and sighs,
acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy. She
turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the face.
Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl.

ELLE
(upset)
Why didn't you call me?

DORKY DAVID
What?

ELLE
We spend a beautiful night together
and then I never hear from you again?

DORKY DAVID
-- uh --

Elle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it.

DORKY DAVID
I'm sorry?

ELLE
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining
sex for me with any other man?

DORKY DAVID
Uh -- both?

ELLE
Forget it. I've already spent too
many hours crying over you.

She rushes off. Dorky David and the Freshman Girl and her
friends watch Elle go. After a moment, the girl turns to
David.

FRESHMAN GIRL
So, urn, when did you wanna go out?

ANOTHER GIRL
I'm free on Friday.

Walking away, Elle hears this and smiles.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

People ascend the wide courthouse steps.

BAILIFF (O.S.)
The first district court is now in
session. The honorable Judge William
R. Ptak presiding.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The DA grills Mrs. Windham Vandermark.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
And what was the defendant doing?

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK
Sitting next to the pool topless,
while the Latin boy handed her a
drink.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

DA Rafferty continues her grilling.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
And where was she exactly?

This time -- Chutney is on the stand.

CHUTNEY
Standing over my father's dead body.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON a tiny Speedo thong.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY (O.S.)
Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what
this is?

We PULL BACK to reveal that the DA is holding it up as she
questions Enrique.

ENRIQUE
My uniform.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
This is the uniform that Mrs. Windham
asked you to wear while cleaning her
pool?

ENRIQUE
Yes.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
And are you or are you not, having
an affair with Brooke Windham?

Enrique shifts in his seat.

ENRIQUE
Define affair.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
Have you inserted your genitalia
into hers?

DONOVAN
Objection --

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
(to Enrique)
Have you and Mrs. Windham had sexual
relations?

ENRIQUE
Yes! Okay? Yes!

The courtroom gasps. Elle looks over at Brooke, who's shaking
her head, outraged.

INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone files out. As Brooke is being led away, she turns
to Elle.

BROOKE
I'm not having an affair with Enrique --
you know a Delta Gamma would never
sleep with a man who wears a thong!
I just liked watching him bend over
to clean the filter --

ELLE
I believe you! Don't worry.

Brooke is taken away.

INT. ELLE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Elle, in sweats and a pony-tail, pours over a mammoth-sized
deposition. A KNOCK sounds.

ELLE
Come in.

Sarah enters.

SARAH
(re the depo)
You done with that yet?

Elle hands the deposition over.

ELLE
Take it. I've read it twenty times.

She grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading.

Sarah lingers.

SARAH
I believe her, too. I don't think
she's having an affair with Enrique.

ELLE
Too bad you and I are the only ones.

SARAH
I'm still can't believe you didn't
tell Donovan the alibi.

Elle looks up, defensive.

ELLE
It's not my alibi to tell --

SARAH
(interrupting)
I know. I thought that was very --
classy of you.

ELLE
(surprised)
Really? Thanks.

Sarah starts to go, then stops.

SARAH
Have you ever noticed that Donovan
never asks Warner to bring him coffee?
He's asked me at least a dozen times.

Elle shrugs.

ELLE
Men are helpless. You know that.

Sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch.

SARAH
Warner can't even do his own laundry.

ELLE
I know. He has it sent out.

SARAH
Did you know he got wait-listed when
he applied? His father had to make a
call.

ELLE
(stunned)
You're kidding!

A KNOCK sounds on the open door and Margot and Serena poke
their heads in.

MARGOT AND SERENA
Surprise!

ELLE
Oh, my God!

Sarah watches as Elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each
have a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in their hands.

ELLE
What're you doing here?!

SERENA
We're on our way to the bridal show
in New York so we thought we'd rescue
you from law school for the night.

MARGOT
(tempting her)
We have a limo downstairs and lots
more of these.

She wiggles her champagne bottle.

ELLE
You guys -- I can't. We're in the
middle of a trial.

SERENA
Where's Warner?

SARAH
(confused)
At the office.

Margot and Serena look over at her.

MARGOT
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with
a nerdy girl.

ELLE
Margot!

SERENA
Bring her, too.
(to Sarah)
C'mon. You can wear one of Elle's
outfits.

SARAH
That's okay --

MARGOT
(to Elle)
Speaking of which, can you please
put on some party clothes? You look
like someone rolled you in something
sticky and dragged you through a K-
Mart.

ELLE
(torn)
I can't believe you guys are actually
here -- but this case is important.
I'll make it up to you after finals,
okay? I -- promise. I really want to
do a good job.

Margot and Serena stare at her, realizing she means it.

SERENA
Okay... Call us if you change your
mind.

They start to head out. Margot hands Sarah the bottle of
champagne.

MARGOT
Here.

She spots The Rock on Sarah's finger and grabs her hand.

MARGOT
Jesus. Talk about a Rock. You must
be better in bed than you look.

Elle hustles them out the door.

ELLE
I'll call you as soon as it's over,
okay? Sisters forever?

MARGOT AND SERENA
Sisters forever.

She shuts the door behind them. Then looks at Sarah.

ELLE
Sorry about that.

Sarah sets down the Veuve.

SARAH
Save it.

She smiles at Elle.

SARAH
We'll drink it after we win.

Elle smiles.

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY

Paulette arranges a nail polish display by the door.

UPS GUY (O.S.)
I've got a big one for you.

Paulette freezes and slowly turns to find UPS Guy holding
out a big package.

UPS GUY
Can you sign?

He hands her the computerized tablet and as he does, the pen
velcroed to the side falls off.

Paulette watches as it FALLS IN SLO-MO. Realizing that now
is the perfect time to try the Bend & Snap.

She bends slowly, tush out, knee cocked. She grabs the pen
and as she prepares to Snap back up, UPS Guy leans over to
help.

UPS GUY
Got it?

Not realizing he's leaning over, she SNAPS back up --

CLOCKING him in the NOSE with her head.

He reels backward, holding his nose, blood flowing as Paulette
stares at him-in horror.

PAULETTE
Oh my God!

CUT TO:

INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Elle waits in line for the water fountain, talking on her
cell phone.

ELLE
(into phone)
You broke his nose?!

We INTERCUT with Paulette as she watches UPS Guy being carried
out by paramedics on a gurney. The ladies of the shop flutter
around him, concerned.

UPS GUY
I'm okay --

PAULETTE
I think he noticed me, Elle --
(sobbing)
But only because I maimed him!

ELLE
(consoling)
I'll be over right after the trial,
okay? We're about to cross-examine
Enrique. And don't worry! My friend
Serena barfed on a guy during "The
Blair Witch Project" and end up dating
him for three months.

She hangs up. Enrique cuts in front of her in line for the
water fountain. She glares at him, tapping her foot.

He finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her.

ENRIQUE
Don't stomp your little Prada sandals
at me, Miss Thing.

He walks past, as Elle gapes at him. Realizing.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Elle grabs Emmett's arm as he whispers with Donovan.

ELLE
He's gay! Enrique is gay!

EMMETT
What?!

She grabs Warner as he's passing.

ELLE
Warner, what kind of shoes do I have
on?

He looks down at her Prada sandals.

WARNER
Pink ones.

ELLE
See?

Donovan frowns, not seeing.

DONOVAN
What are you talking about?

ELLE
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover!
He's making it up. Whoever killed
Heyworth is paying him off.

EMMETT
Back up. How do you know he's gay?

ELLE
Gay men know designers. Straight men
don't.

She points at Warner, who shrugs. Brooke leans over.

BROOKE
What's going on?

ELLE
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.

BROOKE
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool
house once --

Donovan scoffs.

DONOVAN
While I appreciate your masterful
legal theory, I have a murder trial
to attend to.

He grabs Emmett's arm and pulls him aside as they confer on
more serious matters. Emmett looks at her as if to say
"Sorry", before he looks back at Donovan. Brooke looks at
Donovan, then back at Elle, rolling her eyes.

Elle sits down, pissed. Warner is next to her.

ELLE
Thanks for the backup.

WARNER
How was I supposed to know what kind
of shoes you had on?

She looks at him like he's a complete idiot, as the judge
takes his seat.

INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Donovan is in front of Enrique, who is at the stand.

DONOVAN
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof
that you and Mrs. Windham were having
an affair?

ENRIQUE
Just the love in my heart.

Women in the audience openly sigh. Elle makes a puke gesture.
Enid concurs.

Donovan smiles a smug smile.

DONOVAN
If that's all the proof that he has,
your Honor, I think I'm done here.

Emmett stands.

EMMETT
I have a couple of questions, Your
Honor?

Donovan glares at him.

EMMETT
(sotto to Donovan)
Give me two minutes.

He approaches Enrique and starts firing questions at rapid
speed.

EMMETT
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a
date?

ENRIQUE
Yes.

EMMETT
Where?

ENRIQUE
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no
one would recognize us.

EMMETT
And how long have you been sleeping
with Mrs. Windham?

ENRIQUE
Three months.

EMMETT
And what is your boyfriend's name?

ENRIQUE
Chuck.

The audience lets out a gasp. Elle looks up, shocked, then
delighted.

Enrique begins to sweat.

ENRIQUE
I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Chuck is
just a friend.

CHUCK, scrawny and angry, stands up in the audience.

CHUCK
If I'm just your friend, why have we
been doing the slippy-slap every
night for the past six months?

The courtroom ERUPTS and the judge bangs the gavel.

Elle smiles victoriously from her seat. Emmett grins back at
her.

Donovan shakes his head, smiling in amazement.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Elle and Emmett walk down the stairs together in high spirits.
Donovan catches up.

DONOVAN
Good work today, Ms. Woods.

ELLE
Thank you!

He walks on. She looks at Emmett, excited. He high-fives
her.

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT

Paulette is closing up as Elle follows her around.

PAULETTE
(in a giddy, rush)
And after they set his nose, he came
back for his truck and I offered to
drive for him since he was still on
pain-killers and we spent the whole
afternoon together! He was unconscious
for part of it, but it was really
fun!

ELLE
(hugging Paulette)
I'm so happy for you!

PAULETTE
How'd it go at the trial?

ELLE
Great. Donovan actually said the
words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He
takes me seriously! Can you believe
it?

PAULETTE
Of course I can believe it. You're
going to make a great lawyer.

Paulette looks at Elle. Emotional.

PAULETTE
Elle, you've changed my life. You
are the kindest, most wonderful angel.
Without you, I wouldn't have Rufus
or a dinner date. Now go and share
your goodness with the world while I
stay here and have my hoo-hoo waxed.

INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT AND DONOVAN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Elle passes Sarah, who carries a stack of depos into the
conference room to Dick and Bobby.

SARAH
Donovan asked to see you before you
leave.

ELLE
(excited)
Really?

SARAH
He's already got his coffee -- maybe
he needs a donut.

They share a smile as Elle walks over to Donovan's glass-
walled office and knocks on the door. Nervous.

DONOVAN
Come on in.

He beckons her inside, and she goes, shutting the door behind
her.

INT. DONOVAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

He's behind his desk. He motions for her to sit in one of
the two chairs opposite him.

DONOVAN
Sit down.

ELLE
Is everything okay?

DONOVAN
You followed your intuition today
and you were right on target. I
should've listened.

ELLE
(stunned)
Thank you.

DONOVAN
About the alibi --

She sighs.

ELLE
I'm sorry, but --

DONOVAN
(cutting her off)
I'm impressed that you took the
initiative to go there and get it.
That's what makes a good lawyer. And
on top of that, you gained the
client's trust and kept it. That's
what makes a great lawyer. You're
smart, Elle. Smarter than most of
the guys I have on my payroll.

Elle is overwhelmed by his praise.

ELLE
Wow. That means so much to me to
hear you say that.

Donovan walks around his desk and sits in the chair opposite
her.

DONOVAN
I think it's time discuss your career
path. Have you thought about where
you might be a summer associate?

ELLE
(still overwhelmed)
Not really. I know how competitive
it all is --

He smiles.

DONOVAN
You know what competition is really
about, don't you?

Eager for his knowledge, Elle is on the edge of her seat. He
leans in.

DONOVAN
It's about ferocity. Carnage.
Balancing human intelligence with
animal diligence. Knowing exactly
what you want and how far you'll go
to get it. How far will Elle go?

As he says the last sentence, he SLIDES his hand UP HER THIGH.

OUTSIDE DONOVAN'S OFFICE

Sarah walks down the hallway, glancing in Donovan's office
to see --

HER POV --

Donovan's hand sliding up Elle's skirt. She shakes her head
in disgust, and heads off -- NOT SEEING.

INT. DONOVAN'S OFFICE

Elle stares at Donovan in horror, then grabs his hand --
stopping its journey upward.

ELLE
(upset)
You're hitting on me?

DONOVAN
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.

ELLE
So everything you just said --

DONOVAN
I'm a man who knows what I want.

Elle rises, stung. She stares at him for a beat.

ELLE
And I'm a law student who's finally
realized her professor is a pathetic
asshole.

She walks out.

DONOVAN
(calling out)
Too bad. I thought you were a law
student who wanted to be a lawyer.

Elle keeps walking.

INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT ETC. - ELEVATOR - MOMENT LATER

Elle is in the elevator. Flushed and upset. As the doors
start to close, Sarah sticks her arm in, blocking them.

SARAH
You almost had me fooled.

ELLE
What?

SARAH
Maybe you should sleep with the judge
too. Then we can win the case.

Sarah steps back, letting the doors shut.

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

Elle stomps out of the elevator, as Emmett gets in.

EMMETT
(smiling)
Hey --

ELLE
I'm quitting.

She marches past. He follows, catching up.

EMMETT
Whoa -- Why?

ELLE
Law school was a mistake. Getting
this internship was a mistake.

EMMETT
What're you talking about? You earned
it --

She snorts.

ELLE
I didn't earn anything. I got this
internship because Donovan liked the
way I looked. Which he made clear
tonight when he tried to feel me up.

Emmett looks pissed as he processes this.

EMMETT
(mind reeling)
So now you're -- ?

ELLE
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill
my destiny as a useless bimbo and
join the Swedish Bikini Team. No
more navy blue suits. No more panty-
hose. No more trying to be something
I'm not.

EMMETT
What if you're trying to be something
you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.

She stops, giving him a sad smile.

ELLE
Thanks for not treating me the way
everyone else here does. Call me if
you're ever in California.

She walks out. Emmett watches her go, hating it.

EXT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT

Elle's Boxster, packed with suitcases and the potted palm,
pulls up.

INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT

Elle sits in front of Paulette, dejected. Not even bothering
with a manicure.

PAULETTE
(upset)
You can't go home!

ELLE
What's the point of staying? All
people see when they look at me is
blonde hair and big boobs. No one's
ever going to take me seriously. The
people at law school don't, Warner
doesn't -- I don't even think my
parents take me seriously. They wanted
me to grow up and become a Victoria's
Secret model who marries a rock star.
Now, for the first time, it seemed
like someone expected me to do
something better with my life than
wear underwear for a living. But I
was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't
see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a
piece of ass just like everyone else.
It turns out, I am a joke.

She stands up.

ELLE
The hell with law school. I just
came to say goodbye.

IN A NEARBY CHAIR

Professor Elspeth Stromwell spins around, nails drying, facing
Elle.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL
If you let one stupid prick ruin
your life, you're not the girl I
thought you were.

Elle looks at her, shocked, as Professor Stromwell stands
and goes.

INT. JAIL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A TV -- Donovan is being interviewed is on the
evening news.

DONOVAN ON TV
Enrique Salvatore has been discredited
as a witness.

REPORTER #2 ON TV
Did you go in there knowing how you
were going to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

DONOVAN ON TV
Absolutely. It's a little thing I
like to call strategy.

He gives the reporters a smug smile.

IN THE WAITING ROOM

Brooke looks away from the TV. Emmett is next to her, prepping
her for the following day.

BROOKE
Is he always such an ass?

EMMETT
(containing himself)
He's the top defense attorney in the
state. Of course he's an ass.

BROOKE
But is he an ass that's gonna win my
case?

EMMETT
He's an ass that's gonna try.

BROOKE
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?

EMMETT
That's not what's important.

BROOKE
To me it is. He doesn't trust me.
Why should I trust him?

Emmett thinks for a moment. Then looks at Brooke.

EMMETT
You're right. Why should you?

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

People enter. Reporters set up their cameras. Dorky David
passes by in a suit and tie.

INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Donovan and Emmett head into the courtroom.

DONOVAN
Keep that bitch away from me.

EMMETT
She's our client.

DONOVAN
Not Brooke. Elle.

EMMETT
(blatantly pissed)
Funny how a woman can turn into a
bitch just by saying "no".

Donovan glares at Emmett as they continue in.

Behind them -- SARAH stops in her tracks, having heard all
of this.

INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Donovan takes his seat next to Brooke. She smiles at him.

DONOVAN
What're you so happy about? You're
on trial for murder.

BROOKE
Get up.

DONOVAN
What?

BROOKE
You're fired. I have new
representation.

DONOVAN
Who?

The door of the courtroom BANGS open and ELLE STRIDES IN,
dressed in a Prada mini-dress, Underdog in her purse. She
blows a bubble, lets it pop, then sets her briefcase down
next to Donovan's.

ELLE
(to Donovan)
Excuse you. You're in my way.

She nudges him aside. Donovan looks at Brooke.

DONOVAN
She's a law student. She can't defend
you.

Dorky David steps up, holding out a marked casebook.

DORKY DAVID
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
Rule 3:03.

ELLE
(to Donovan)
See?

JUDGE
Counselors, approach the bench.

Elle starts to head up.

DONOVAN
You're not going up there.

ELLE
Yes, I am.

BROOKE
(to Donovan)
I don't think you heard me. You're
fired. She's my lawyer.

JUDGE
Counselors, now. All of you.

Elle, Donovan and Emmett head up, as does the DA. Elle hands
the judge the case book.

ELLE
Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of
the Supreme Judicial Court states
that a law student may appear on
behalf of a defendant in criminal
proceedings.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
(stoked)
I have no problem with this.

DONOVAN
I do. I'm not allowing it.

ELLE
(pointedly)
But you agreed last night. In the
office? When we were discussing my
"career"?

The implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at
her.

JUDGE
(reading the casebook)
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise
you. Mr. Donovan?

DONOVAN
That, I won't agree to.

Emmett steps forward.

EMMETT
I'm supervising, Your Honor.

Elle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle,
completely derailed.

JUDGE
Well, then, Ms. Woods. Proceed.

Elle walks back to the table with a grin. Warner looks
shocked.

IN THE AUDIENCE

Paulette beams, the UPS Guy in the nose brace, next to her.

Serena and Margot, now in attendance, STAND clapping and
squealing in a completely inappropriate way.

SERENA
Go, Elle!

Donovan takes a seat in the audience. As he passes by Brooke:

DONOVAN
Enjoy prison.

The judge looks at Brooke.

JUDGE
Mrs. Windham, you do realize what
you're doing?

BROOKE
Absolutely.

As Donovan sits, Margot leans over.

MARGOT
Don't fuck with a Delta Gamma.

AT THE DEFENSE TABLE

Sarah leans forward to Elle, who gathers her notes.

SARAH
Kick some butt.

Elle looks at her, surprised.

JUDGE
Ms. Woods, call your first witness.

ELLE
I'd like to recall Chutney Windham
as a defense witness.

The crowd murmurs. Donovan rolls his eyes.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chutney takes her hand off of the Bible and sits.

JUDGE
Ms. Woods, begin your questioning.

ELLE
First, your Honor, I'd like to point
out that not only is there no proof
in this case, but there's a complete
lack of mens rea, which by definition
tells us that there is no crime
without a vicious will.

The DA rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present.

JUDGE
I am aware of the meaning of mens
rea. What I am unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson
instead of questioning your witness.

Flustered, Elle turns to Chutney.

ELLE
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh
arrived back at the house? Was your
father there?

CHUTNEY
Not that I saw. But like I said, I
went straight upstairs to take a
shower.

ELLE
And when you came downstairs, what
happened?

CHUTNEY
I saw Brooke standing over his body,
drenched in his blood.

ELLE
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

CHUTNEY
No, she'd stashed it by then.

Brooke rolls her eyes.

EMMETT
Move to strike that from the record,
your Honor. Speculation.

JUDGE
Stricken.

Elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself.
Eirimett gives her a reassuring nod. She takes a deep breath,
then continues on.

ELLE
Did you hear a shot fired?

CHUTNEY
No. I was in the shower.

ELLE
So at some point in the -- twenty
minutes you were in the shower, your
father was shot?

CHUTNEY
I guess.

Elle paces a bit. Underdog watches from her purse on the
table, intrigued by her line of questioning.

ELLE
Your father was shot while you were
in the shower?

Gerard looks at Emmett.

GERARD
Where's she going with this?

EMMETT
Have a little faith.

ELLE
But you didn't hear the shot, because
you were in the shower.

CHUTNEY
(annoyed)
Yes. I was washing my hair.

Elle's onto something, but not sure what.

ELLE
Miss Windham, can you tell us what
you'd been doing earlier in the day?

CHUTNEY
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to
the gym, got a perm, and came home.

ELLE
Where you got in the shower.

CHUTNEY
(impatient)
Yes.

JUDGE
I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was in the shower.

People start to murmur. Donovan snickers. Sarah looks worried.

ELLE
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten
a perm before, Miss Windham?

CHUTNEY
(confused)
Yes.

The beginnings of a smile start to spread across Elle's face.

ELLE
How many, would you say?

CHUTNEY
Two a year since I was twelve. You
do the math.

ELLE
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.
Even though we all told her not to.
Curls really weren't the right look
for her --
(chummy)
She didn't have your bone structure.

Chutney almost smiles.

ELLE
But, thankfully, that same day, she
entered the Pi Kap wet t-shirt contest
where she was completely hosed down
from head to toe.

Donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.

DA JOYCE RAFFERTY
Objection. Why is this relevant?

Emmett clears his throat, worried. Elle turns around, giving
him a "trust me" look. Then turns back to the judge.

ELLE
(to the judge)
I have a point. I promise.

JUDGE
Then make it.

Elle looks at Chutney.

ELLE
Chutney, why is it that Tracy
Marcinko's curls were ruined when
she got hosed down?

CHUTNEY
Because they got wet.

ELLE
That's right. Because isn't the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance
that you are forbidden to wet your
hair for at least twenty-four hours
after getting a perm at the risk of
de-activating the ammonium
thiglycolate?

Chutney pales.

CHUTNEY
Yes --

Elle continues.

ELLE
And wouldn't someone who's had thirty
perms throughout her lifetime, be
well aware of this rule?

Chutney doesn't answer. She just glares at Brooke.

ELLE
And if you, in fact, were not washing
your hair, as I suspect you were
not, since your curls are still
intact, wouldn't you have heard the
gunshot?

Chutney continues to glare.

ELLE
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot,
then Brooke Windham wouldn't have
had time to hide the gun before you
got downstairs. Which would mean
that you would've had to have found
Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand
to make your story sound plausible.
Isn't that right?

CHUTNEY
She's younger than I am. Did she
tell you that? How would you feel if
your father married someone younger
than you?

ELLE
You, however, had time to hide the
gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you
shot your father?

Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing.

CHUTNEY
I didn't mean to shoot him --
(to Brooke)
I meant to shoot you!

Pandemonium erupts. The gavel pounds.

BROOKE
I knew it!

Elle looks at Emmett, elated at what's just happened.

ELLE
(shocked)
Oh, my God!

EMMETT
(even more shocked)
Oh, my God!!

INT. COURTHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Reporters mob Elle and Brooke as they make their way out of
the courtroom.

REPORTER
Elle, how did you know Chutney was
lying?

BROOKE
Because she is brilliant.

ELLE
(humble)
The rules of haircare are simple and
finite. Any Cosmo girl would've known.

The reporters laugh as they snap pictures of her and a happy
Brooke.

INT. WOODS' BEL AIR HOME - GYM - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON THE TV -- the channels change: golf -- a commercial --

ELLE IN THE COURTHOUSE.

DANIEL (O.S.)
What the -- ?

Daniel, Elle 's father, watches TV as he does his morning
workout on the treadmill.

DANIEL
Honey, stop!
(proud)
Ellie's on TV!

He looks next to him, where Sapphire is upside down on a
yoga inversion machine.

SAPPHIRE'S POV -- THE UPSIDE-DOWN TELEVISION WITH ELLE ON
IT.

SAPPHIRE
Oh, my God! What happened to her
tan?

INT. COURTHOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

As the reporters continue to mob Brooke, Elle steps aside to
talk to Serena and Margot.

SERENA
I wish we could stay longer, but I
have a game.

ELLE
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!

MARGOT
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.

ELLE
(grinning)
Not yet.

Enid walks up to the girls.

ENID
(to Elle)
Even though you knew your shit today --
you're still a product of the
patriarchy and a creation of the
male-dominated media. And so are
your friends.

She looks at Serena.

ENID
(to Serena)
Although -- you're kinda hot. Call
me.

She walks off. Serena looks alarmed.

ELLE
(hugging them)
Don't worry. She's harmless. I'll
see you guys soon! Thanks for coming!

She air-kisses them as Margot leads a still shell-shocked
Serena away as Emmett walks up to Elle.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY - LATER

Elle looks up at the courthouse as the sun sets behind it.
She smiles, proud of herself.

WARNER (O.S.)
You were amazing today.

She turns and finds Warner.

ELLE
Thank you.

He moves closer.

WARNER
It made me realize something. I'm an
idiot.

ELLE
Really?

He turns on the charm.

WARNER
I want to be with you, Elle. Forever.

He pulls her close, hand around her waist, kissing her. She
looks up at him, a trace of the old love in her eyes. For a
moment, she melts.

ELLE
I want to be with you, too, Warner.

After a moment, she steps back, removing his hand from her
waist and wrenching it behind his back.

ELLE
In court. On opposing sides.

WARNER
(shocked)
Are you serious?

ELLE
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.

She walks down the steps. Warner watches her go, then turns
to see Sarah, who's witnessed the entire episode. She glares
at him, then walks past.

WARNER
Sarah -- hold on.

She shoves him, knocking him on his ass, then rushes to catch
up with Elle.

SARAH
(calling out)
Elle, wait up --

Elle turns.

SARAH
(sheepish)
I'm a bitch.

ELLE
Yes, you are.

SARAH
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming
on to you.

ELLE
Yes, he is.

They look at each other in a silent truce.

SARAH
So -- can we drink that champagne
when I get back from the pawnshop?

She pulls off her engagement ring.

ELLE
You're pawning The Rock?!

SARAH
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study
for. In Jamaica.

She smiles and heads off. Elle smiles, processing this as
Emmett approaches Elle.

EMMETT
Up for a celebration dinner?

ELLE
Are you asking me on a date?

EMMETT
As long as you realize I'm not just
some man-toy you can show off like a
trophy.

ELLE
(joking)
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an
early class tomorrow.

EMMETT
So Friday at eight?

She smiles at him.

ELLE
Perfect.

She heads down the stairs, stops and thinks a moment, then
runs back up -- Grabbing Emmett in a hellacious KISS. He
kisses her back.



We CRANE UP as they embrace on the courthouse steps.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL QUAD - DAY

"Welcome Law Students Class of 2004" banners hang over
orientation tables. Nervous first year students stand in
line.

We PAN ACROSS a row of club tables -- passing "Harvard Law
Journal" and "Environmental Law Association" -- until we
reach a table that proudly bears the banner of "Blonde Legal
Defense Club".

Elle, in a red 2L t-shirt, stands behind the table,
straightening some flyers. UNDERDOG is plopped down on top
of the stack. Elle turns to see EMMETT next to her.

EMMETT
(re Underdog)
Someone missed you.

ELLE
Is he the only one?

EMMETT
What do you think?

They kiss.

EMMETT
(re the crowd)
Looks like you're pretty popular.

Elle smiles, turning back as A NERVOUS 1L GIRL steps up.

NERVOUS 1L GIRL
Do you have to be blonde to sign up?

ELLE
Only blonde at heart.
(to the girl next to
her)
Right?

Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH.

Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of
first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to
sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.

FADE OUT:
[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a
bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The
lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop
and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens
again. The old man is now ahead of him.]

Cut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling
papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He
passes and he turns it back up again.

Cut to Samir. He grabs the steering wheel and shakes it in frustration.

SAMIR
Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass!! I just -

He hits the steering wheel.

Cut to Milton at a bus stop. TN

He mumbles his coming lines, as he does with all his lines.

MILTON
It's late again. If I'm there late again, I will be dismissed.

[Scene: Initech parking lot. Bill drives into his special spot.
(Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche
(license plate: MY PRSHE) and walks in. Peter walks in too.]

Cut to inside. Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch
the metal handle. It gives him a shock and he enters.

Cut to the cubicles. Peter goes into his. He picks up papers, turns on
the computer and sits down.

NINA
Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment.

(repeats that over and over)

Bill comes up to Peter.

BILL
Hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh… we have sort of a problem here.
Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS
reports.

PETER
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot.

BILL
MMMM..YEAH. YOU SEE, WE'RE PUTTING THE COVERSHEETS ON ALL TPS REPORTS
NOW BEFORE THEY GO OUT. DID YOU SEE THE MEMO ABOUT THIS?

PETER
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just
forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no
problem.

BILL
Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on,
that will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another
copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok?

He walks away.

PETER
Yeah, yeah, I've got the memo, I've got -

He picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle.

BILL
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

Peter tries to read his papers, but a loud radio (news) is bothering
him. He stands up and sees it's Milton.

PETER
Milton? Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

MILTON
Uh, they said I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from
nine to eleven while I'm collating….

PETER
But, no, no, no. I know you're allowed to, I was just thinking, like a
personal favor, y'know?

MILTON
I, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while
she' working, I can listen to the radio while I'm collating -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
So I don't see why -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
The radio, I can't -

PETER
Yeah! All right!

He sits down.

MILTON
I enjoy listening to the radio at a reasonable volume from nine to
eleven.

Dom walks up.

DOM
Hello, Peter. What's happening?  (Big smile)We need to talk about your
TPS reports.

PETER
Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh, Bill talked to me about it.

DOM
Yeah. Uh, did you get that memo?

PETER
Yeah. (holds it up) I got the memo. And I understand the policy. The
problem is, I just forgot this time. And I've already taken care of it
so it's not a problem anymore.

Dom nods.

DOM
Yeah. It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS
reports before now before they go out now. So I'd really appreciate it
if you could just remember to do that. from now on. That'd be great.

He walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it.

PETER
Peter Gibbons. (listens) Yes. (listens) I have the memo.

[Scene Another part of the room. Paper jams in the printer.]

SAMIR
Oh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper
jam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I, I, I just kick this
piece of shit out the window!!!

MICHAEL
you and me both, man. The thing is lucky I'm not armed.

Samir grabs the paper out, tearing off the bottom part of it.

SAMIR
Piece of shit!!

Nina comes with papers.

NINA
Sam...ire...Na...Na...Naga...

Samir gets it.

NINA
Uh-huh!

SAMIR
Please.

He sits in his and Michael's cubicle.

NINA
Michael… - (Michael reaches for it) Bolton?

MICHAEL
That's me.

NINA
Wow! Is that your real name?

MICHAEL
Yeah.

NINA
So are you related to the singer guy?

MICHAEL
No, it's just a coincidence.

SAMIR
How come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na-
gee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar

MICHAEL
At least your name isn't Michael Bolton.

SAMIR
Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name.

MICHAEL
There was nothing wrong with it. Until I was about nine years old and
that no-talent assclown became famous and started winning Grammys.

SAMIR
Well, why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael?

MICHAEL
WHY SHOULD I CHANGE IT? HE'S THE ONE WHO SUCKS.

Peter comes up to their cubicle.

PETER
HEY GUYS.

MICHAEL
What's up G?

PETER
Wanna go to Chotchkie's, get some coffee?

SAMIR
It's a little early...

PETER
I gotta get out of here. I think I'm gonna lose it.

NINA
Uh oh. Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

[Scene Chotchkie's. They're sitting at a booth thing.]

PETER
Boy. I tell ya, one of these days... One of these days it's gonna be
like

He mimics a machine gun. Brian, a waiter, does it too, in Peter's face.

BRIAN
(LAUGHS)
SO CAN I GET YOU GENTLEMEN SOMETHING MORE TO DRINK? OR MAYBE SOMETHING
TO NIBBLE ON? SOME PIZZA SHOOTERS, SHRIMP POPPERS, OR EXTREME FAJITAS.

PETER
Just coffee.

BRIAN
Oh. Sounds like a case of the Mondays.

He goes to take some more orders.

PETER
What if we're still doing this when we're 50?

SAMIR
It could be nice to have that kind of job security.

PETER
Lumbergh's gonna have me work on Saturday, I, I can tell already. I'm
doing it because, because, uh, I'm a big pussy. Which is why I work at
Initech to begin with.

MICHAEL
Uh, I work at Initech and I don't consider myself a pussy, ok?

SAMIR
Yes, I am also not a pussy.

MICHAEL
I'm gonna find out the hard way that I'm not a pussy if they don't
start treating us software people better.

SAMIR
That's right.

MICHAEL
They don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip
that place off big time…big time.

PETER
Yeah.

Cut to Joanna, a pretty waitress.

Cut back to the guys.

PETER
Oh, there she is.

SAMIR
Peter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with
her, why don't you just ask her out?

PETER
Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a
waitress and ask her out.
(cut to Joanna, and back to them)
Plus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me.
I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.

MICHAEL
Why not?

PETER
Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.

MICHAEL
Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?!

PETER
Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just
think, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me.

MICHAEL
Yeah. I know what you mean.

SAMIR
Yeah.

PETER
What is that supposed to mean?

MICHAEL
Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you
want to play poker with us?

PETER
Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I
think the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight.

SAMIR
Peter, she's anorexic.

PETER
Yeah, I know. The guy's really good.

MICHAEL
An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of
your problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you
having problems with your TPS reports?

SAMIR
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

Peter sighs.

[Scene Outside Initech. Tom, another employee, runs across the street,
towards Samir, Peter and Michael.]

TOM
Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!!

SAMIR
Is that Tom Smykowski?

PETER
What's he doing?

MICHAEL
Oh, probably working on another heart attack.

TOM
Have you guys see this?

He hands them a piece of paper.

MICHAEL
What? It's the staff meeting. So what?

TOM
We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech.

SAMIR
Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that?

TOM
They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this
staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year.
You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency
experts. You're interviewing for your own job!

MICHAEL
Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.

TOM
I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought
of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in
line with those scumbags!!!

[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.]

MICHAEL
Shit. Shit.

TOM
You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with
all this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see,
that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with
some really great idea like that and you never have to work again!

MICHAEL
I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.

TOM
The guy made a million dollars! Y'know… I had an idea like that once.

PETER
Really? What was it, Tom?

TOM
Well, all right. It was a Jump… to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would
be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different
conclusions written on it that you could…jump to.

MICHAEL
That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

SAMIR
Yes, yes, it's horrible…this idea….

TOM
Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I
still have a job.

He goes to his cubicle.

PETER
Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if
we had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably,
whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you
wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.

SAMIR
So what did you say?

PETER
I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.

MICHAEL
No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to
begin with.
(The printer is not working)
If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would
clean shit up if they had a million dollars.

SAMIR
Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest
of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.

MICHAEL
Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you
want to do. And then…
(reads the printer's display)
"PC load letter"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!!

He knocks off the paper tray.

[Scene Peter's apartment. He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch.
He then turns on the TV.]

LAWRENCE
(V/O, FROM NEXT DOOR)
HEY PETER-MAN! CHECK OUT CHANNEL NINE! IT'S THE BREAST EXAM! CHECK OUT
THIS CHICK!

PETER
Lawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through
the wall?

LAWRENCE
Oh! I'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something?

PETER
No! But if you just want to talk to me, just come over.

Lawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds.

LAWRENCE
Hey man. Check this out, dude.

He changes channels a bunch of times

Pepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast
exam.

PETER
Oh geez, Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look
like Anne?

PETER
Yeah, a little bit.

LAWRENCE
Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out?

PETER
I guess, yeah. I, I don't know. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's
cheating on me.

LAWRENCE
Yeah, I get that feeling too, man.

PETER
What do you mean by that?

LAWRENCE
I don't know , man, I just get that feeling looking at her, like - I'm
sorry, man. Look, I, I, I, I, I, I'm talking out of my ass. I don't
know.

He gets up.

PETER
It's ok. I just had a rough day.

LAWRENCE
Tell me about it, man.
(sits on the couch)
I gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag
myself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the
new McDonalds.

PETER
Let me ask you something. When you come in on Mondays, and you're not
feeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say "sounds like
someone's got a case of the Mondays"?

LAWRENCE
No. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you get your ass kicked for
sayin' something like that, man.

PETER
Huh.

LAWRENCE
We still going fishing this weekend?

PETER
Nah. Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it.

LAWRENCE
Well, you can get out of that easily.

PETER
Yeah, how?

LAWRENCE
(Gets up)
Well, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of
the day, right?
(gets a beer)
So all you have to do is avoid him –
(peter offers him a bottle cap remover)
That's all right, i got one –
(he gets on from his pocket)
The last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you
should be home free then.

PETER
That's a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you
do if you had a million dollars?

He sits down.

LAWRENCE
I'll tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.

Peter laughs.

PETER
That's it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two
chicks at the same time?

LAWRENCE
Damn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a
millionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks dig guys with money.

PETER
Well not all chicks….

LAWRENCE
Well, the type that double up on a guy like me do.

PETER
Good point.

LAWRENCE
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

PETER
Besides two chicks at the same time?

LAWRENCE
Oh yeah.

PETER
Nothing.

LAWRENCE
Nothing, huh?

PETER
I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.

LAWRENCE
You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my
cousin. He's broke and don't do shit.

[Scene Peter's room. He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices.]

NINA
Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll,
Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a
moment.

Peter buries his head in his pillow.

[Scene The staff meeting. Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37.
Everyone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says
"Is This Good for the COMPANY?"]

BILL
So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points
to the banner) Is this good for the company? Am I helping the best way
that I can for the company...

PETER
Is that the guy?

TOM
Yeah...

BILL
Good. Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh,
Bob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant. Yeah. He is a
consultant. (Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little
here, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more
smoothly. Yeah. Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So,
y'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and
jeans.

[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with
Peter.]

MILTON
I, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told
Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk
four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels
and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the
Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red
Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston
and I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler.

PETER
Ok, Milton.

MILTON
And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on
fire.

PETER
Oh, that's great. I will talk to you later.

He hangs up and looks at his watch

4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill
talking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the
computer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys.

PETER
Oh, come on! (it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh,
for crying out -!

He peeks over the wall again. The computer finally finished saving and
he turns it off. He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there. He gets
ready to leave and almost runs into Bill.

BILL
Hello Peter. What's happening? Um, I'm gonna need you go ahead and come
in tomorrow. So if you could be here around nine, that would be great.
(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yea…I forgot. I'm gonna also need you to
come in Sunday too. We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to
sorta catch up. Thanks.

[Scene Outside the clinic. A sign says

Hypnotherapist; Dr. Swanson, CCS; Anxiety, Depression, Marriage, Weight
Loss, Smoking, Insurance

Cut to inside. Anne is with Peter. Opposite them are Dr. Swanson and
two other patients.

PETER
So I'm sitting in my cubicle today and I realized that ever since I
started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the
day before it. So it means that every single day you see me, that's on
the worse day of my life.

DR. SWANSON
What about today? Is today the worse day of your life?

PETER
Yeah.

DR. SWANSON
Oh, that's bad stuff.

PETER
I'm sorry.

DR. SWANSON
Ok.

PETER
But is there any way that you, you could just sock me out so there's no
way that I'll know I'm at work? Right here? (points to his head) Can I
just come home and think I've been fishing all day or something?

DR. SWANSON
That's really not what I do, Peter. However, the good news is, I think
I can help you. I want you to do something for me, Peter. (dims the
lights) I want you to try and relax. I want you to relax every muscle
in your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now I want you to
relax your legs. You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting
heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete
relaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing. Deeper, way
down, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now when
I count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete
relaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you
will remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three. Deeper and
deeper. Way down, way down. Two. Way down. One.

He faints out of the chair and everyone rushes to his aid.

ANNE
Oh my God, Dr. Swanson! Ooh! Ooh! Is he dead? Oh!

She runs to get help. Peter just sits there and smiles. The hypnosis
thing apparently worked...

[Scene Peter's bedroom. Saturday morning, 8:00. His alarm clock beeps
and he sits up. He looks at the clock and decides to go back to sleep.]

Cut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings and the answering
machine picks up.

BILL
Yah, hi. It's Bill Lundbergh. It's about ten o' clock, uh, wondering
where you are.

Cut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings again.

BILL
ON MACHINE) YEAH, HI, IT'S BILL LUMBERGH AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE YOU KNEW THAT WE, UH, DID START AT THE, UH, USUAL TIME THIS
MORNING. (PETER ROLLS OVER...) YEAH, IT ISN'T A HALF DAY OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. SO IF YOU COULD GET HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THAT WOULD BE
TERRIFIC.

Cut to later. Peter finally gets up. The answering machine has
seventeen messages. He listens to them.

BILL
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lum -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, it's -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, it's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute. Just
checking in case you called while I was gone.

The phone rings. Peter answers it.

PETER
Hello?

ANNE
Peter, what's going on?!

PETER
Huh?

ANNE
It's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?!

PETER
Because I didn't feel like it.

ANNE
Peter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson
dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my
friends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull!

Peter hangs up but Anne calls back.

ANNE
ANSWERING MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE
THROUGH!!! AND –HA- ONE MORE THING. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!!!! (BEEP

Peter gets back into bed.

[Scene Initech. Another staff meeting.]

BILL
From now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job
codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in. Otherwise, use
the old time sheets...

TOM
Where's Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend?

MICHAEL
I, I don't know.

BILL
...it would really, really help us out.

MICHAEL
POINTS) WHO'S THAT GUY?

BILL
So, uh, any questions?

[Scene Chotchkie's. Peter enters and goes up to Joanna at the counter.]

PETER
Hi, I'm Peter.

JOANNA
Hi. How can I help you?

PETER
What are you doing for lunch today?

JOANNA
Well, our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over
there on the board. (points) Excuse me.

She goes to take orders.

BRIAN
Hey! Look who's back! Table for three, to -

Peter shoves him out of his way and goes over to Joanna.

PETER
I was asking what you were doing for lunch. Would you like to have
lunch with me?

JOANNA
Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do
that.

PETER
Oh. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a
table and if you'd like to join me, no big deal. All right? And if not,
that's cool too. Ok?

He starts to walk away.

JOANNA
Uh, when you say "next door", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?

PETER
Flingers.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Initech. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom.]

BOB SLYDELL
So what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and
you bring them down to the software engineers?

TOM
That, that's right.

BOB PORTER
Well, then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the
specifications directly to the software people, huh?

TOM
Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with
customers.

BOB SLYDELL
You physically take the specs from the customer?

TOM
Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.

BOB SLYDELL
Ah.

BOB PORTER
Then you must physically bring them to the software people.

TOM
Well...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes.

BOB SLYDELL
Well, what would you say… you do here?

TOM
Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so
the engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at
dealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!!

CUT TO THE CUBICLES. TOM EXITS THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND MICHAEL ENTERS.

Cut to inside.

BOB SLYDELL
Let's see. You're Michael...Bolton?

He nods.

BOB PORTER
Is that your real name?

MICHAEL
Yeah.

BOB PORTER
Are you in any relation to the pop singer?

MICHAEL
It's just a coincidence.

BOB SLYDELL
LAUGHS) TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL
BOLTON FAN. FOR MY MONEY, I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY BETTER THAN WHEN HE
SINGS WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.

BOB PORTER
I mean you must really love his music.

MICHAEL
Yeah. Yeah…he, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess.

BOB SLYDELL
You're GOD DAMN right he is.

They laugh.

BOB PORTER
So tell me. What's your favorite song of his?

MICHAEL
Hmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.

The Bobs laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
HA HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean,
having the same name as him. I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue.
But anyway, let's get down to business, Michael!

MICHAEL
You, you know, you can just call me Mike.

They stare at him.

[Scene Flingers. Peter is saving a table and Joanna enters.]

JOANNA
Hi.

PETER
Hey.

JOANNA
I wonder if they will let me wear this in here.

PETER
I think it would be ok. Would you like to sit down?

He motions to a chair.

JOANNA
Ok. (does so) Wow. This place is really nice.

PETER
Yeah, is it?

JOANNA
Oh my God, compared to Chotchkie's. I like the uniforms better anyways.

PETER
I like yours.

JOANNA
Nah. (makes a face

Peter looks at the buttons' wearing on his suspender. One says We're
not in Kansas anymore. The one underneath says POOF.

PETER
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

JOANNA
Yeah. Really. (laughs

PETER
It's on your - (points

JOANNA
Oh! That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.

PETER
What are pieces of flair?

JOANNA
That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff.
We're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair.
quite stupid actually.

PETER
Do you get to pick them out yourself?

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just
grabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say!
Y'know, I don't really care. I don't really like talking about my
flair.

PETER
Ok.

JOANNA
So, where do you work, uh, Peter?

PETER
Initech.

JOANNA
And, uh, what do you do there, Peter?

PETER
I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.

JOANNA
NODS) WHAT'S THAT?

PETER
You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put
98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code
and uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't
think I'm gonna go anymore.

JOANNA
You're just not gonna go?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Won't you get fired?

PETER
I don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?

PETER
No, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going.

JOANNA
When did you decide all that?

PETER
About a week ago.

JOANNA
Really?

PETER
Oh, yeah.

JOANNA
Ok. So, so you're gonna get another job?

PETER
I don't think I 'd like another job.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS?

PETER
Y'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that
either.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

PETER
I want to take you out for dinner and then I wanna go to my apartment
and watch Kung Fu. Did you ever watch Kung Fu?

Joanna gets a weird look on her face.

JOANNA
I love Kung Fu...

PETER
Channel 39.

JOANNA
Totally...

PETER
You should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight.

JOANNA
Ok...

PETER
Great.

JOANNA
Ok. Can we order lunch first?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Milton's cubicle. He hears bill talking and eavesdrops.]

BILL
...stapler off my desk...

Milton puts his Swingline stapler somewhere else. The guys laugh.

BILL
...anyway, sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off)
Hey, Milton, what's happening?

MILTON
Uh...sir...

BILL
Uh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could
get it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be
great.

MILTON
No, no, because I was, I was -

BILL
That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put
in here.

MILTON
No...sir...

BILL
Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.

MILTON
No. No.

BILL
Let me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get
to that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch,
Milton. Bye.

He walks off.

MILTON
Ok. I'll set the building on fire.

[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks
up to him.]

MICHAEL
Peter!

PETER
Michael!

MICHAEL
What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here
and start shooting.

PETER
I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a
number I don't wanna lose.

MICHAEL
What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on
Saturday. What were you doing?

PETER
Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

MICHAEL
Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know,
you're supposed to be having your interview right now with the
consultants.

PETER
Who?

He writes down Joanna's number.

MICHAEL
What has gotten into you?

PETER
Oh yeah. Right.

MICHAEL
Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make
something up.

PETER
Ah, no way. I feel great.

[Scene The interview room.]

BOB PORTER
The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.

Peter enters.

BOB SLYDELL
Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter
Gibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate,
Bob Porter.

PETER
Hi, Bob. Bob.

BOB PORTER
Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?

He does so.

BOB SLYDELL
Y'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel
for how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk
us through a typical day for you?

PETER
Yeah.

BOB SLYDELL
Great.

PETER
Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side
door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta
space out for about an hour.

BOB PORTER
Space out?

PETER
Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that
for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a
given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.

BOB SLYDELL
Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a
little more?

PETER
Let me tell you something about TPS reports...'

Cut to later. Peter is more relaxed.

PETER
The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't
care.

BOB PORTER
Don't, don't care?
PETER
It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and
Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's
the motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different
bosses right now!

BOB SLYDELL
I beg your pardon?

PETER
Eight bosses.

BOB SLYDELL
Eight?

PETER
Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different
people coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is
not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob,
it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.

BOB SLYDELL
Bear with me for a minute.

PETER
Ok.

BOB SLYDELL
Believe me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some
kind of stock option and equity sharing program?

PETER
I don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice
talking to be of you guys.

He shakes their hands.

BOB SLYDELL
Absolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.

PETER
Good luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.

BOB SLYDELL
Wow.

Cut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.

BILL
Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -

Peter walks right past him.

[Scene Chotchkie's]

STAN
Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?

JOANNA
I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.

STAN
I need to talk about your flair.

JOANNA
Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him

STAN
Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?

JOANNA
Ok.

STAN
Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare
minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a
terrific smile.

JOANNA
Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more?

STAN
Look. Joanna.

JOANNA
Yeah.

STAN
People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's
for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about.
It's about fun.

JOANNA
Ok. So, more then?

STAN
Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare
minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we
encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah.

STAN
Great. Great. That's all I ask.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]

BOB SLYDELL
Right. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom
Smykowski.

BILL
He's useless.

BOB SLYDELL
Gone.

DOM
Sounds good to me.

BOB SLYDELL
Here's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.

DOM
Who's he?

BOB
You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.

DOM
Oh.

BOB SLYDELL
We can't find a record of him being a current employee here.

BOB PORTER
I looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed
off about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through
a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed
the glitch.

BILL
Great.

DOM
So, um, Milton has been let go.

BOB SLYDELL
Just a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he
won't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

BOB PORTER
We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is
solved from here on, then.

They laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
Uh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this
young man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all
over him.

BILL
Ooh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with
you there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that
he's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having
some problems with his TPS reports.

BOB PORTER
I'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.

BOB SLYDELL
Um-um.

BOB PORTER
It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really
motivated.

BOB SLYDELL
There it is.

BILL
Yeah, I'm not sure about that now.

BOB PORTER
All right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you
say you deal with these TPS reports?

BILL
Yeah...

[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He
takes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]

Cut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.

Cut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.

Cut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to
pull off the bumper.

Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.

LAWRENCE
Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!

Cut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not
there.

Cut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a
big fish.

Cut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.

DOM
Hello, Peter.

PETER
Hey Dom!

He slaps him on the back.

Cut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut
it. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.

Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.

Cut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it
over. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.

[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as
Bill walks up.]

BILL
So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have
those TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh,
yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk,
hmm?

PETER
Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to
have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a
meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.

BILL
Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.

PETER
Yeah, they called me at home.

BILL
That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all
fixed up for you later.

[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]

MILTON
F...C...P...

BILL
Hi, Milton. What's going on?

MILTON
I, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.

BILL
Uh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.

MILTON
I, I did and they, and they said -

BILL
Uh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.

MILTON
No...I...I...

BILL
Uh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can
get.

MILTON
No...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -

BILL
And if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care
of the roach problem we've been having that would be great. (He walks
away.

MILTON
I can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?

[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs.]

BOB PORTER
It looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.

PETER
I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.

They laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
That's terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some
of the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a
little (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.

PETER
Well, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.

BOB PORTER
Well, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...

BOB SLYDELL
Naga...

BOB PORTER
Naga-worker here anyway!

The Bobs laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
Mr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.

PETER
You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?

BOB PORTER
We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in
Singapore, that's the usual deal.

BOB SLYDELL
Well, it's standard operating procedure.

PETER
Do they know about this yet?

BOB SLYDELL
No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a
Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an
incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we
would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as
many as four people working right underneath you.

BOB PORTER
This is a big promotion, Pete.

BOB SLYDELL
Huge.

PETER
So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?

BOB SLYDELL
Umm-hmm.

PETER
Wow!

[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]

MICHAEL
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me.
Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need.
Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-

Peter walks up to him.

PETER
Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight?

[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]

PETER
There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is
now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.

MICHAEL
Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're
the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious
experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or
you're gonna get canned.

PETER
Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one
that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...

MICHAEL
Yeah? What about it?

PETER
Well, how does it work?

MICHAEL
It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank
transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in
fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it
takes those remainders and puts it into your account.

PETER
This sounds familiar.

MICHAEL
Yeah. They did this in Superman III.

PETER
Yeah. What a good movie.

MICHAEL
A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.

PETER
Well, so they check for this now?

MICHAEL
No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're
updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.

PETER
You're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all
that code.

MICHAEL
It's numbers up their asses.

PETER
So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?

MICHAEL
It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.

PETER
What if you didn't have a good job?

[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]

MICHAEL
Cockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you,
you haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.

PETER
Actually, I'm being promoted.

MICHAEL
What?!!!

PETER
Yeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something
today. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all
of us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the
other day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I
saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't
have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this
way. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at
computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to
eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.

MICHAEL
I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.

PETER
that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass
off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing
or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go
in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know
why? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael,
let's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place
that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software
works right?

MICHAEL
Of course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work,
I don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software
loan.

PETER
Yeah? But Samir does.

[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]

SAMIR
But that's not much money, I -

PETER
That's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.
That's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it
out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.

MICHAEL
Just like Superman III.

SAMIR
Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to
get my resume ready.

PETER
Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for
no reason?

SAMIR
That's right! If I'm lucky.

PETER
Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed
around. Aren't you?

SAMIR
Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.

PETER
Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't
Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they
can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum
security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have
conjugal visits there?

SAMIR
Really.

PETER
Yes.

MICHAEL
Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.

SAMIR
So what do you think?

MICHAEL
This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.

PETER
You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock
of that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two
options

unemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?

SAMIR
I have a question.

PETER
Yes.

SAMIR
In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?

PETER
Yep. You sure can.

SAMIR
Ok. I'm gonna do it.

PETER
That's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!

MICHAEL
Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right?

PETER
All right.

MICHAEL
All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to
do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the
rest.

PETER
Ok, you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but
listen. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God,
Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no
girlfriends, nobody!

SAMIR
Of course.

MICHAEL
Agreed.

LAWRENCE
Don't worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!

MICHAEL
Who the fuck is that?!

PETER
Uh, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see
it all going down...

[Scene Initech. Peter shakes the Bobs' hands.]

BOB SLYDELL
Peter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.

BOB PORTER
And we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.

(They give a thumbs up.

[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle. They look at each other. Michael
copies the virus and looks around. He gives it to Samir. Samir walks by
Peter and gives it to him. He puts it into his computer and copies the
file. He goes to Samir and Michael's cubicle.]

MICHAEL
Well, that was easy.

PETER
Yeah, I guess it was.

MICHAEL
What did you do with the -

DREW
Hey guys.

PETER
Oh, hey Drew.

DREW
did you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?

MICHAEL
The guy who got laid off?

DREW
No, man, check this out.

[Flashback. Tom's getting drunk in his kitchen.]

DREW
V/O) LAST WEEK, AFTER HE FOUND OUT HE WAS GETTING LAID OFF, HE TRIES TO
KILL HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE CAR IN THE GARAGE.

Cut to Tom in his car.

MICHAEL
V/O) IS HE DEAD?!

DREW
V/O) BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND
HIM IN THE CAR AND TRIES TO PLAY IT OFF AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

TOM
COUGH) I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I,
I COULDN'T GET IT INTO DRIVE. I, I, I MEAN, REVERSE.

MRS. SMYKOWSKI
Are you ok, Tom?

TOM
Yeah.

DREW
V/O) AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.

TOM
I'm ok.

MRS. SMYKOWSKI
Right.

TOM
It seems to be working now. See ya later, honey. Love ya.

He backs out.

DREW
V/O) BUT THEN AS HE BACKS OUT INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE'S SLAMMED BIG TIME
BY A DRUNK DRIVER.

We hear a bang from behind the closing garage door.

Cut back to Initech, present.

PETER
Well, is he ok?

DREW
Sort of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his
back. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this.
Like seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and
he's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take
that new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh!
Oh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys
there.

[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael are with him.]

MICHAEL
Wow, our last day at Initech.

SAMIR
I can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna
steal something.

PETER
I stole something.

MICHAEL
Oh yeah. I guess we all did.

PETER
No, I stole something else.

SAMIR
What did you steal?

PETER
We'll call it a going away present.

[Scene A field. They drop the printer. Samir stomps on it four times
and Michael, eight times. Peter hands Samir a bat. He hits the printer
twice and Michael takes over. He starts to punch it. Samir and Peter
pull him away, but he runs back to destroy the evil printer.]

Cut to Peter's place. Samir's trying to break dance.

[Scene Outside Peter's place.]

PETER
Everything is going to be ok. Ok?

SAMIR
The one I see is -

PETER
I can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over.
Don't worry! You're worrying! All right? Monday morning we're gonna
check the account balance and everything will be all right. Don't miss
Tom's barbecue. I'll see you there.

Peter goes inside.

SAMIR
RAPPING) BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...

[Scene Peter's place, morning. Joanna sees all the empty liquor
bottles.]

JOANNA
Hey, what were you guys celebrating last night?

PETER
Um, I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.

[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.]

PETER
So when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these
extra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify
the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into
an account that we own.

JOANNA
So you're stealing.

PETER
Ah, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh,
it's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh,
over time, they add up to a lot.

JOANNA
Ok. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Ok. That's not yours?

PETER
Well, it, it becomes ours.

JOANNA
How's that not stealing?

PETER
I don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this
Seven Eleven, right? If you take a penny from the tray -

JOANNA
From the crippled children?!

PETER
No, that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for
everybody.

JOANNA
Oh, for everybody. Ok.

PETER
Yeah, well, those are whole pennies.

JOANNA
Yeah.

PETER
Right. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it
from a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong
with that?

JOANNA
It seems wrong.

PETER
It's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all
right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get
up in the morning and put on pieces of flair?

JOANNA
Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the
register!

PETER
You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear
them.

JOANNA
What?!

PETER
Look, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go
to the barbecue, all right?

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a
full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.]

TOM
Michael! Samir! How are you doing?

MICHAEL
Hiya Tom.

SAMIR
Hi Tom.

TOM
Yeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands)
Rob, Michael.

ROB
Hello Michael.

TOM
Samir.

ROB
Hello -

SAMIR
Samir.

ROB
...Samir.

(Peter and Joanna enter.

TOM
Peter!! How are ya? I'm glad you could make it.

PETER
Tom! Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna.

JOANNA
Hi.

TOM
Hi. Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone
joins in nervously) Ooh...Ooh... Uh, Peter, Peter, come here a minute.
I want to show you something.

They go into the kitchen. There's a Jump to Conclusions mat. It says
??? ; Jump Again ; Strike Out ; Could be ; Loose one Turn ; Yes! ; No!
; Accept it ; Go wild ; One step back ; Think Again ; Moot! On the
bottom are footprints, under the word Start

TOM
Well, what do you think? It's a prototype.

PETER
Well, that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about
your settlement. Congratulations.

TOM
Well, thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to
talk to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I
just wanted you to know that's how you feel. I used to be the same way.

PETER
Really?

TOM
Sure. Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as
you and I've been doing good for over thirty years!

PETER
Wow.

TOM
Just remember

If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen. I mean, look
at me.

He laughs.

PETER
Thanks Tom.

TOM
Aw, sure.

[Scene The backyard. Samir and Michael are talking to Rob.]

ROB
Conjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is
no picnic. I have a client in there right now. You see, the trick is,
kick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch. Then
everything will be all right. Why do you ask, anyway?

MICHAEL
Oh, no, we were just seeing -

His cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere.

Cut to Peter and Drew.

DREW
Hey Peter.

PETER
Drew.

DREW
That's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
Lucky bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at
Chotchkie's?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
Hmm, who's she here with?

PETER
She's here with me.

DREW
Really?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
All right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

PETER
Why's that, Drew?

DREW
Are you kidding me? She gets around, all right?

PETER
She does, does she?

DREW
Oh yeah. Like a record.

Joanna waves.

PETER
With who?

DREW
Well, let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else...

PETER
Lumbergh?!

[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are leaving the party.]

JOANNA
Oh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is
such a good idea.

PETER
ANGRY) YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP
WITH LUMBERGH!

JOANNA
What?! What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh...

PETER
ARGH!!! AH GOD! LUMBERGH!!

JOANNA
Peter! What is wrong with you? That was like to years ago! What, do you
know him?

PETER
Yeah, I know him!! I know him! He's my boss!! He's my unholy,
disgusting, pig of a boss!!

JOANNA
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

PETER
He represents all that is solace and wrong! And you slept with him!

JOANNA
That is none of your business, ok? I didn't ask you who you slept with
before we were together. I don't care!

PETER
Well, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!

JOANNA
Listen to you! Who do you think you are? How dare you judge! Do you
think you're an angel or something? No! You're this petty, stealing,
wannabe criminal...man!

PETER
Well, I may be. But at least I never slept with Lumbergh!!

JOANNA
Ok. That's it. I'm done. I want to get out of the car. Stop. I wanna
get -

PETER
Fine.

He stops and Joanna gets out.

JOANNA
Why don't you call me when you grow up? Oh, wait, that's probably never
gonna happen so just don't call me, all right?

PETER
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!!!

She slams the door and he drives off.

[Scene Peter's room. He's having nightmares again.]

DREW
Lumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...

BILL
Oh that's great…great…

DREW
I'm gonna see the O-face again. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh!

That dissolves into Bill, naked, holding a foot in one hand a cup of
coffee in the other.

BILL
Why don't you move it a little to the left? That's right. Great. Oh,
hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh, could you give me those TPS reports
ASAP? Mmmkay?

Peter wakes up and breathes deeply.

[Scene Chotchkie's. Stan approaches Joanna.]

STAN
Joanna?

JOANNA
Yeah?

STAN
We need to talk. Do you know what this is about?

JOANNA
My, uh, flair.

STAN
Yeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen
pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna.

JOANNA
Umm-hmm.

STAN
What do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum?

JOANNA
Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want
me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over
there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of
flair?

STAN
Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I
don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the
finger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself.
(holds up her hand) There it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn
job and I don't need it!!

She storms out.

[Scene An ATM machine. Peter gets out a receipt that says he has
$305,326.13]

[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael have obviously seen the
receipt.]

SAMIR
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit! This is a - fuck! Son of
a bitch! Shit!

MICHAEL
What happened?

PETER
You tell me, Michael, it's your software!

SAMIR
Yes, it's your software!

PETER
Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the
receipt) 26.13!! Michael!!

MICHAEL
Oh shit! They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or
three days.

PETER
Michael! Michael! You said the thing was gonna take two years!

SAMIR
What happened?!

PETER
You said the thing was supposed to work.

MICHAEL
Well, technically it did work.

PETER
No it didn't!

SAMIR
It did not work, Michael, ok?!

MICHAEL
Ok! Ok!

SAMIR
Ok?!

MICHAEL
Ok! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place
or something. Shit. I always do that. I always mess up some mundane
detail.

PETER
Oh! What is this fairly mundane detail, Michael?!!!!!

MICHAEL
Ok quit getting pissed at me, all right? This was all your idea,
asshole.

PETER
All right. Ok. All right. Let's try not to get pissed off at each
other, all right? We'll figure this thing out together, ok? And the
first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it
gets any bigger.

[Scene Initech. It's Bill's 41st birthday. All the employees are
singing the birthday song to him in a flat monotone. He blows out the
candles and everyone claps.]

ALL
Mmm. You look terrific. (etc

BILL
All right, Kate, you wanna get everybody started there. (he gets a
slice of cake) Mmm. That is terrific. That is just terrific. I really,
really appreciate it.

A slice is handed to Milton.

NINA
Milton, don't be greedy. Let's pass it along and make sure everyone
gets a piece.

MILTON
Can I keep a piece? Because last time I was told that -

NINA
Just pass.

He does so.

MILTON
But this, this, it, it, it's a little cake...

Everyone gets a piece and Nina gets the last one. Milton has to watch
everyone enjoy their piece.

[Scene Peter's apartment. They're trying to figure out what to do.]

SAMIR
Is, is there a way to just give the money back?

PETER
What? We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing?
I, I think they'd figure that out.

SAMIR
Well, we have to do something.

MICHAEL
May-maybe we launder the money.

PETER
That's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that?

MICHAEL
I don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's
something I think, I think coke dealers do.

PETER
Ok. Do we know any coke dealers?

MICHAEL
My, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit.

SAMIR
Yes. We are in very, very deep shit.

[Scene Milton's new "office" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece
of cake.]

BILL
Milton?

MILTON
Yes.

BILL
What's happening?

MILTON
I wanted to see you because -

BILL
Say, you know what would be a great idea?

MILTON
No...no.

BILL
Since you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca
of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having
in here.

MILTON
I...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my -

BILL
For now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and -

Dom enters.

DOM
Bill! We need you upstairs right away. Some major glitch in the
accounting. A lot of money missing.

They go upstairs and Bill turns off the light.

MILTON
Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that's the last straw.

[Scene Peter's place. Michael is looking up "money laundering" in the
dictionary.]

MICHAEL
LAUNDERING. TO CLEAN...NO, UH, HERE IT IS. TO CHANNEL MONEY THROUGH A
SOURCE OR BY AN INTERMEDIARY.

SAMIR
It doesn't really help us, Michael.

PETER
Ok. We're looking up money laundering in a dictionary.

MICHAEL
Yeah, well, you guys can both eat my ass, ok?

PETER
My girlfriend slept with Lumbergh, that's what I can't believe.

SAMIR
Yeah, you didn't know that?

MICHAEL
It happened two years before you moved to Atlanta.

PETER
You mean, Ron Lumbergh, the airshow guy?

MICHAEL
Yeah, who did you think she slept with, Bill? (He and Samir start
laughing) If she fucked him, their children would have hooves!

PETER
Ron's not related to Bill, is he?

Someone rings the doorbell.

MICHAEL
Who is it?

He hides the checks while Peter goes to the door.

PETER
Don't panic. It's probably just the mailman.

He opens the door.

STEVE
MONOTONOUSLY) HELLO SIR. MY NAME IS STEVE. I CAME FROM A ROUGH AREA. I
USED TO BE ADDICTED TO CRACK BUT NOW I'M OFF AND TRYING TO STAY CLEAN.

PETER
Ok.

STEVE
That is why I am selling magazine subscriptions.

PETER
No -

STEVE
I was hoping you would help me out.

MICHAEL
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You used to be addicted to crack?

STEVE
Yes, but not anymore.

Cut to later. They've got Steve in an armchair, trying to get him to
help.

STEVE
Look, I'm sorry. I do not know anything about money laundering.

MICHAEL
Look, we're not asking you if you know about money laundering, we're
just trying to see if you can hook us up.

PETER
He doesn't know anything, all right?

SAMIR
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of
one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills.

STEVE
NORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP
ME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER.

PETER
You're a software engineer?!

SAMIR
Working must be, must be very hard for you.

STEVE
I made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did
working at Initrode.

MICHAEL
Huh? You worked at Initrode?

PETER
You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we
know a lot of the same people.

STEVE
Actually, that all depends.

He holds up his clipboard.

Cut to later. Peter closes the door.

PETER
What am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ?

MICHAEL
I wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I
can't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia
guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly
at it?

SAMIR
We're new to it, though. If we had more experience -

MICHAEL
No. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence
all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder
money, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money,
we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're
gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison.

SAMIR
I don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've
never done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly
because you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're,
we're worried about going to prison!

PETER
Don't worry about it. I'll think of something.

SAMIR
Ass. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter.

Samir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall.

PETER
Lawrence! You awake?

LAWRENCE
Yeah, man!

PETER
You wanna come over?

LAWRENCE
No thanks, man. I don't want you fucking up my life too!

[Scene Peter's room. He dreams that they're in court, with Rob as their
lawyer.]

JUDGE
And now the sentence for these heinous crimes committed against
Initech. I hereby sentence you, Michael Bolton and Samir
Na...Ananajibad...to a term of no less than four years in federal-
pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. Peter Gibbons, you've lead a trite and
meaningless life. And you're a very bad person.

The judge bangs the gavel and Peter wakes up.

[Scene The living room. Peter is up, feverishly writing a confession.
He tears it out and puts it into an envelope with the checks.]

[Scene Flingers parking lot. Peter sits on the hood of his car, trying
to figure out what to do. Joanna comes out.]

JOANNA
Hey.

PETER
Hey. You're not working at Chotchkie's anymore.

JOANNA
No, no, I got fired.

PETER
What happened?

JOANNA
I flipped off my boss. And some customers - actually a line just
happened to be standing there, so...

PETER
I'm going to go away for awhile. Uh, to jail. Yea, about that computer
scam, you were right…it was a bad idea. I'm going to take the blame for
it, I decided. I'm going to return the money and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door. Joanna, I wanna apologize. I had no right to get
pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem. It wasn't even the right
Lumbergh. I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy, like
I'm supposed to like everybody else.

JOANNA
Peter, most people don't like their jobs. But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

PETER
Yeah. I may never be happy with my job. But if I could be with you, I
think that I could be happy with my life. But if you could give it
another shot, I promise, Joanna -

JOANNA
Oh shut up.

They hug and kiss.

BRIAN
Hey, what's going on here? Get a room you two!

He makes an annoying noise and gives them the finger.

JOANNA
I hate that guy.

[Scene Initech. Peter drives up.]

Cut to inside. Peter sticks the envelope under the door of William
Lumbergh, Division Vice President. He walks away but frantically runs
back and tries to get the envelope. He can't reach it and finally gives
up.

[Scene Initech. Morning. Milton is talking to an secretary. Lumbergh
hasn't gotten to work yet.]

MILTON
...to Mr. Lumbergh and he told me to talk to Payroll and then Payroll,
they told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh. And I still haven't gotten my
paycheck and they stole my stapler and they told me to move my desk to
Storage Room B and there was garbage all over it and I don't appreciate
that.

SECRETARY
Um, why don't you go and sit at your desk. Mr. Lumbergh should be here
any minute.

MILTON
Mr. Lumbergh -

SECRETARY
Just go and sit at your desk.

MILTON
But -

SECRETARY
Oh?

MILTON
Ok, I, I, I'm going to set the building on fire. I tell him, if I don't
get my stapler (the secretary leaves) I'm going to have to get my
stapler back because it is my stapler. (he goes into Mr. Lumbergh's
office) It's my stapler, the Swingline. It's been mine for a very long
time.

[Scene Peter's room. He's packing his clothes. He goes outside and
knocks on Lawrence's door.]

PETER
Hey, Lawrence, are you there?

LAWRENCE
Hey, Peter, man.

PETER
Hey. So, I may be going away for awhile.

LAWRENCE
Yeah, I know, man. It's a bummer, dude, what can I say?

PETER
Yeah. Well, it's time to go face the music. You take care of yourself,
cause I don't wanna see ya.

They shake hands.

LAWRENCE
You too, man. Take care. (Peter starts to leave) Hey Peter! Watch out
for the corn hole ok?

PETER
Ok, Lawrence.

[Scene Peter's car. He's driving along when he sees something.]

Cut to Initech. It's on fire, big time. Peter joins the crowd of his
co-workers and watches. Milton walks away quickly. A structure falls
and Peter laughs.

Cut to inside, a burning cubicle.

[Scene The burned ruins of Initech. Peter is now a construction worker,
working alongside Lawrence. Lawrence digs up Milton's burnt Swingline.]

PETER
Let me see this.

LAWRENCE
Who would want that stapler, man? That's toasted, man.

PETER
I know someone who might want this.

A car horn beeps. Michael and Samir step out of the car.

MICHAEL
Hey man! Wanna go out to lunch?

PETER
I brought mine in a pail. Plus, Joanna's supposed to come by later.

SAMIR
So, how do you like your new job?

PETER
It's not too bad. Not too bad. How's Penetrode?

MICHAEL
Initrode.

PETER
Initrode.

SAMIR
It's work.

PETER
Yeah. Yeah.

MICHAEL
I could probably get you a job if you want.

PETER
No, thanks. I'm doing good here.

MICHAEL
So, uh, we're gonna be ok, right?

PETER
Yeah. I think the fire pretty much took care of everything.

SAMIR
But what if the money burned up? It's too be a scheme.

PETER
Yeah...

SAMIR
Are you sure you don't want us to get you a job?

PETER
That's the one thing I'm definitely sure of.

MICHAEL
All right, G.

PETER
You guys take care!

SAMIR
Ok.

MICHAEL
Stay in touch, man!

PETER
Ok, will do. (They get in the car and leave) This isn't so bad, huh?
Making bucks, getting exercise, working outside.

LAWRENCE
Fuckin' A.

PETER
Fuckin' A...

[Scene

A beach. Milton is relaxing and a waiter comes up to him.]

MILTON
Excuse me. Excuse me, Senor. May I speak to you please? I asked for a
mai tai, a margarita, and a pina colada. I asked for no salt, no salt
in the margarita. But it had salt in it. (the waiter leaves) If you do
that again, I won't be leaving a tip. I won't be putting one down. Sir?
I could check into a competing resort...

FADE IN

A white title appears on a black screen.

"One doesn't discover new lands
without consenting to lose sight
of the shore for a very long time."

Andre Gide

The title fades off, replaced by a second title.

"We're all in this alone."

Lily Tomlin


INT.  A WOMB.  DAY.

A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he
gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of
his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a
tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed
lips.  He sucks his thumb.


INT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.

A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached,
smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up
by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by
the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the
newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost
immediately, a cry.

From another angle we see the crying infant on a television
screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO


INT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING.

The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying.
TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the
edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the
wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He
cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears.

Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban
street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and
lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in
front of his idling car.

Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of
shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism.

He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that
all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though
the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but
there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up
what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of
his car and drives away.


INT.  CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of
a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into
his Styrofoam cup of coffee.  Stirring it in with his finger, he
burns himself.

TRUMAN
Shit!

As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of
children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School,
adjacent to the parking lot.  The sound of the children triggers
a memory in his head.


EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears
to be playing on a television screen.

A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on
the beach.

The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand,
flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the
father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight
of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his
bottle in the sand and run to him.

The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father
comes within earshot.

FATHER
(out of breath, clutching his side)
Truman!  Truman!  Stop!

Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
anger and distress on his father's face.

FATHER
Come down now!

His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts
his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at
the other side.  One good stretch would do it.

FATHER
(reading Truman's mind, enraged)
No!

TRUMAN
(sensing his father is keeping
something from him)
Why?  What's there?

FATHER
(unconvincing)
Nothing's there.  It's the same as this.
(trace of desperation)
Come down, please!

Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS
have stopped their activities to stare at him.  Reluctantly
he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.  When he finally
jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and
drags him away down the beach.

FATHER
I told you to stay close.  Don't ever leave
my sight again.  You gotta know your
limitations.  You could've been washed
away by the tide.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks
briskly down the bustling street.  A snarl of taxis, buses and
COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under
Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.

Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of
Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy
pages.  Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and
finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a
portion of the open page and pockets the cutting.

He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the
Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.

TRUMAN
(quickly recovering)
Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".

VENDOR
We ran out.

TRUMAN
(hastily departing)
Thanks anyway.

As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo
and instantly turns to the torn page.  It is a Lancome
advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing.
Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to
confront him, almost as if he were expecting it.

Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow
out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective
glass.  He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his
gut, but quickly concedes defeat.  The image triggers another
childhood memory.


INT.  SCHOOLROOM.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television
screen.

The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of
a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-
so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.  DOUGLAS, the boy
next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-
year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.

DOUGLAS
I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.

SISTER
(impressed)
Tell the class what a chiropractor does,
Douglas.

DOUGLAS
He helps people by fixing their backs,
Sister Olivia.

SISTER
That's right, Douglas.
(holding her back, hamming it up)
Perhaps I'll be your first patient.

The CLASS titters.  Douglas sits down, pleased with himself,
throwing a smirk to Truman.

SISTER
What about you, Truman?

Truman rises to his feet.

TRUMAN
I want to be an explorer
(with reverence)
...like Magellan.

The Sister's face falls.

SISTER
No one's going to pay you to do that,
Truman.
(with scarcely disguised glee)
Besides, you're too late.  There's
nothing left to explore.

The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

From TRUMAN'S POV we see that he is staring up at relief
letters that proclaim, "American Life & Accident Insurance,
Inc." above an office building's entrance.

A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat, wanders in Truman's
direction.  From another angle, we observe Truman from the
Police Officer's POV - shaky, handheld camera - on a television
screen.  Truman enters the building.


INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR.  DAY.

In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, TRUMAN talks on
the telephone.

TRUMAN
(into receiver)
...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...
I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance
is death insurance...you just gotta ask
yourself two questions...one, in the event
of your death, will anyone experience
financial loss?...and two, do you care?

A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.  He
checks the spine - "MORTALITY STATISTICS, 1986 to Present".

TRUMAN
(into receiver)
Hold on will ya?
(to Clerk, putting receiver
to chest, referring to the book)
This's no good.  Lumps all drownings
together.  I need drownings broken down
by category.

The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues
his rounds.

TRUMAN
(returning to his call)
...just think about what I've been
saying and lemme...hello?...

The person on the other end has hung up.  With an apathetic
shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.  He looks over his shoulder
and places another call.

TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)
Can you connect me with directory
inquiries in Sydney, Australia?
(a long delay makes Truman
even more uncomfortable)
...er, yes.  Do you have a listing
for a Lauren Powers...
(pause)
...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia
Powers...nothing?  Thanks...

Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.


INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME.

TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR
WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE,
has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a
meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes
at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own
predictability.

TYRONE
(nauseatngly cheerful)
How's it goin', Truman?

TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

TYRONE
(not listening to Truman's
reply, as Truman anticipated)
Good.  Good.

TRUMAN
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

TYRONE
(not missing a beat)
I'd ask for identification.

Truman forces a half-smile.

We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash
register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About
to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke
from the FEMALE CASHIER.

FEMALE CASHIER
(a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)
He's right there.  You're supposed to pay
when he's here.

MALE CUSTOMER
(nonchalant shrug as he departs)
He never notices.

We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped
sandwich from Tyrone.

TYRONE
Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya.

Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that
features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus'
Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's
eyes widen at the photograph.

TYRONE
(referring to the photo)
The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese
navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me.

TRUMAN
(averting his eyes with difficulty)
Not me.  You got the wrong man.

Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays
the Cashier and exits.

TYRONE
See ya tomorrow, Truman.


EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park.
From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The
Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout.
Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders
and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient
wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book.


INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

Close up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white,
late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.

He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room.
Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep
blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears
down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears.

Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television
monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed
in his book, silently plays.

CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited,
joins Christof at the window.

CHRISTOF
(never taking his eyes
from the monitor)
You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the
road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know
you shouldn't look, but you do.


INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around
a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting
room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of
the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one
of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.

MAN
Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough
insurance.

He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again.


INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.

TRUMAN
(into receiver)
...this isn't about insurance, this is
about the great variable - when will
death occur?  Could be a week, a month,
a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather,
minding his own business, gets stabbed in
the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
umbrella...No way you can guard against
that kinda thing, no way at all...

The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs
up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by
several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the
corner of the cubicle.

LAWRENCE
(handing Truman some documentation)
Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in
Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.

Truman turns pale.

TRUMAN
Stapleton on Staten Island?

LAWRENCE
(sarcastic)
You know another one?

TRUMAN
I can't do it.

LAWRENCE
(insistent)
A half hour across the bay.  Sea air.  Do
you good.

TRUMAN
No, I...
(searching for a plausible excuse)
...I got an appointment uptown.

LAWRENCE
This is a sure thing.
(conspiratorial)
They're upping our quota.  You need this.

Lawrence exits the cubicle.  Truman's head drops.  He picks up
the framed picture of his wife from his desk.  MERYL, early
thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.  He deposits
the photo in his briefcase and departs.


INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the
Staten Island ferry.

As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto
the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the
scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering
a flashback in his head.


EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a
small sailing dinghy.

TRUMAN
(shouting above the wind)
Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go further!

FATHER
(shouting back)
It's getting late, Truman.

TRUMAN
(entreating his father)
Please!...

Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading
towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon.


INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide
of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street
into the bright sunlight, gasping for air.

Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street
subway station.  Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as
he departs.

COMMUTER 1
(commenting out of Truman's earshot)
I can't believe he's taking the long way.

COMMUTER 2
He'll never make it.


INT.  SUBWAY TRAIN.  DAY.

TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his
watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief.


INT. TAXI.  DAY.

A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten
Island.  TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across.
refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor.


EXT.  BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.  DAY.

TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do
condominium on Bay Street.  As he approaches the lobby, he
realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his
suit jacket.


INT.  CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his
hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.  Anticipating
Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and
swiftly departs through a rear door.  TRUMAN enters the lobby
and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at
his sides to hide the perspiration.

TRUMAN
I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.

CONCIERGE
You from the insurance company?  You missed him.

TRUMAN
When will he be back?

CONCIERGE
Vacation.  Two months.  He waited as long as
he could.  You was supposed to be here by four.

A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm.


INT.  SUBWAY.  AFTERNOON.

TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated.
The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid-
thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens,
sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.

YOUTH 1
(to woman)
You wanna read to me?

His companion smirks.

YOUTH 1
(more insistent)
You wannna read to me?

The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now.
She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The
other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.

YOUTH 2
(menacing)
My friend asked you a question.

The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and
holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance,
briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in
Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere.
Truman quickly averts his gaze.

WOMAN
(reaching for the book)
Please...

The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips
out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt
pocket.

YOUTH 2
Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.

The train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable,
the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing
a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman
realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through
the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman
but still he remains in his seat.

YOUTH 1
We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.

One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it
in the woman's face.

YOUTH 2
Don't you wanna know how it ends?

The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of
their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction.
Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.

WOMAN
(screams)
Help!!  Please, help!!

The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes.
Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There
is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the
handle but moves no further.

The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of
the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches
under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows
his head in shame as the train rattles on.


INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY.

The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the
WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid.
The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve
her shoulder bag.

WOMAN
Thanks.

The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong
friends.

WOMAN
(pondering the incident)
He did nothing.

YOUTH 1
(shrugs, suddenly more couth)
Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always
has.


EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond
the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy
Expressway.

TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL,
pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a
sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new
knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately
on the cheek.

MERYL
(proudly referring to the knife-set)
I got it free with the tune-up.

Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch
of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.

MERYL
You missed a section.

Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and
obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As
the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,
Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for
Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters.

TRUMAN
(referring to her hands)
Do they hurt?

MERYL
I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.
One of the keys kept sticking.

Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He
notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK".

TRUMAN
(referring to the article)
Is he gonna take the stand?

MERYL
(dispassionate, matter-of-fact)
No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him
near the dumpster where they found the legs.

She flexes her arthritic wrists.

MERYL
You gonna eat before you leave?

TRUMAN
I'll get something out.

MERYL
(sensing something odd
in his demeanor)
Did something happen today?

Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.

TRUMAN
(composing himself)
What could happen?


EXT.  UNOPENED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

An abandoned freeway project in Queens.  The four hundred yard
stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.  At one end
is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel
protuding from the concrete.

TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty-
two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big.
Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up
golf ball with a number three wood.

Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the
ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the
adjacent operating roadway.  From a new angle we see the ball
take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and
continue down the asphalt.

Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred
golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, "T".  Truman sets
the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into
his second shot.  With a slight fade, the second ball carries
even further than the first.

Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.
Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.

MARLON
Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?

TRUMAN
(opening a beer from the six pack)
Mine.

Marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter "M".

TRUMAN
I gotta get out, Marlon.

MARLON
(mild interest only)
Yeah?  Outta what?

TRUMAN
Outta my job, outta Queens...out!

Marlon takes a practise swing.

MARLON
Outta your job?  What the hell's wrong
with your job?  You gotta great job.
You gotta desk job.  I'd kill for a desk
job.

Marlon addresses the ball and swings.  A sweeping hook shot
that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.

MARLON
(annoyed by the errant tee shot)
Sonofabitch.

TRUMAN
It doesn't mean anything.

MARLON
(still looking in the
direction of his ball)
Nothing means anything.  Try stocking vending
machines for a living.  My biggest decision
of the day is whether the Almond Joys look
better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.

Truman selects another "M" ball from the bucket and tosses it to
Marlon.

TRUMAN
(adamant)
I gotta get out.

Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in
the other direction.  A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement
fairway.

MARLON
(skeptical, picking up his beer)
Sure and go where?

Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.

TRUMAN
(unable to disguise his reverence)
Australia.

MARLON
(impressed)
No shit.  Where is Australia exactly?
Near England?

Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.  He points to a
dimple on his make-shift globe.

TRUMAN
See here, this is Queens.
(sliding his finger around
the other side of the ball)
All the way round here, Australia.  You
can't get any further away before you start
coming back.
(tossing the world in his hand,
warming to his subject)
Y'know, there're still places in Australia
where no human being has ever set foot.

MARLON
(still dubious)
So when are you leaving?

TRUMAN
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.
You can't just up and go.
(heading off Marlon's skepticism)
Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about
that.  I just gotta move slow.  Pick a
moment.  Bonus time's just around the
corner.  Soon as I get a retaining wall
built on the back of the house I can
start thinking about selling up...and I'll be
gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.
(as if to convince himself)
I'm going, don't you worry about that.

Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond
his imagination.

MARLON
I never knew anybody who got out.

An awkward moment.  Truman, once again, not so sure of himself.
He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT.  FREEWAY.  LATER THAT NIGHT.

TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway, retrieving
the golf balls.  As they return them to the bucket they check
the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their
long-drive competition.

TRUMAN
(slightly the worse for drink)
Tick-fucking-tock.  That's the fucking
problem, Marlon.  I'm thirty-four.  I'm
older than Jesus Christ.

Marlon looks sideways at Truman.  It sounds to him like the beer
talking.

TRUMAN
Where do the dreams go, Marlon?

MARLON
(picking up the last ball marked with an
initial "T", trying to ignore the question)
You win.

TRUMAN
I'm serious.  Where do the dreams go?

MARLON
(humoring his maudlin friend)
They're still there.  Just buried under what
we settled for.

They approach Truman's Oldsmobile.  Truman opens the trunk to
deposit their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains
of the fallen light fixture.

TRUMAN
(referring to the light)
You really think it could've dropped off an
airliner?

MARLON
(unimpressed)
Sure.  It's halogen.  You oughta report it.
(quickly changing the subject)
You coming for a drink?

TRUMAN
I can't tonight.


EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's
flashbacks.  A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly
weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN-
YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping
MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the
gathering.

The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and
cumbersome in his tiny hands.  He heaves it off the dock.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO


EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.  NIGHT, PRESENT.

A smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water
beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.  TRUMAN stares at the
wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the
shoreline.

In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand.
He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and
points a corded microphone at the surf.  For a long while we
watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the
lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible
through the gloom.

We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.  From the
light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we
observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.

TRUMAN
(shouting at the surf)
I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!


INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a
television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the
water's edge.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

At the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a
school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.  MERYL appears
in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.  She
throws her arms around Truman's neck.

MERYL
(suggestive)
What are you doing?  Come to bed.

TRUMAN
(ignoring the suggestion)
I figure we could scrape together eight
thousand.

MERYL
(suddenly exasperated)
Oh.  God, everytime you and Marlon--

TRUMAN
--We could bum around the world for a year
on that.

MERYL
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to
where we were five years ago.  You're talking
like a teenager.

TRUMAN
Maybe I feel like a teenager.

Getting to his feet.  Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking
excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were
courting.

TRUMAN
Meryl, it'd be an adventure.

MERYL
We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that
enough of an adventure?

TRUMAN
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See
some of the world.  Explore.

Meryl gives a derisive laugh.

MERYL
You want to be an explorer?  You mean like
all the other great explorers from Queens?
You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I
bet you don't even know how to get one.

The words sting.  Truman turns away.

Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack.

MERYL
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this
now and then.
(making one more attempt
at seduction)
Come to bed.


EXT.  A NIGHTWATCHMAN'S OFFICE SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

In a nightwatchman's office, two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee.

GUARD 1
How can they have a child?

GUARD 2
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

GUARD 1
Why not?

GUARD 2
You think she'd go through with it?
(reassessing his own opinion)
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear
looking down at his bed.  MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for
him, snoring lightly.  Truman rests his hand tentatively on the
bed.  The surface rocks.  A waterbed.  The motion triggers a
flashback in his head.


EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAWN, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen.
The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small
dinghy in calm, deep water.

TRUMAN
(plaintively calling into the mist)
Daddy!!...Daddy!!...

His cries go unanswered.


INT.  A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

Two OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa
against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they
talk.  Nothing else of the room is seen.

OLD WOMAN 1
(playing amateur psychiatrist)
It left him with more than his obvious fear
of the water.  It's as if he felt his father
had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed
never to repeat the mistake.  He was never
the same curious little boy again.

OLD WOMAN 2
We're all born with a pound of cocaine
up our nose.  By the time we're eleven
it runs out.

OLD WOMAN 1
Half the people I knew named their
babies after him.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the
newspaper stand. He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through
the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA
SCHIFFER's nose from one of the pages.  He returns the magazine
to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the
rush hour pedestrian traffic.

Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he
glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly
behind him.  Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels
around to face him.  The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties.
more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a
serene smile on his face.

From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a
television screen.  The Homeless Man places his hand ever so
gently on Truman's cheek.  Truman makes no effort to withdraw.
He is transfixed by the the man's eyes.  He appears to recognize
him.

TRUMAN
(almost to himself, mouthing
the word)
Daddy...

Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog and a
YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in
opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man,
one taking each arm.

A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group,
doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman
and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus.
Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors,
closing sharply in his face.

TRUMAN
(to BUS DRIVER)
Hey, stop!  Stop!!

Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores his
cries and the bus roars away from the curb.  He starts to run
after the bus, colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no
attempt to avoid him.

Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi.
A vacant cab suddenly switches off its "FOR HIRE" light as he
reaches it.  Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the
closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is
apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts.

Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and
grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised
parking attendant's kiosk.  Running along the rows of parked
cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons
attached to the key rings

A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's
winking sidelights.  He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns
the car.  The PARKING ATTENDANT, alerted by the squealing tires,
appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down.

ATTENDANT
(running after the car)
Hey!

Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street
without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take
evasive action.

Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the
car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists.  He is
only a couple of car-lengths from the bus.

TRUMAN
(reading aloud, the
ID number of the bus)
Two, four, oh, six.

Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to
slow for no apparent reason.  Truman looks for a way around
but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage,
working together almost as if they are running interference.

TRUMAN
(shouting at the cars)
Outta the way!  Outta the way!

The bus is escaping.

Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering
PEDESTRIANS.

The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his
progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move.
By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are
clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam.  Truman
spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and
disappear from view.

Fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns
to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together
behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go.

The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath
PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat.

ATTENDANT
What the fuck are you trying to pull?!

TRUMAN
(cowering, the fight instantly
gone out of him)
I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done!
No harm done!

ATTENDANT
(feverishly inspecting the
fenders for dents, he finds none)
I oughta fuck you up!

The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.  They get
the better of him.

ATTENDANT
Get the fuck outta here.

The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and
brushes him aside.  As he departs, Truman notices that the
traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of
pedestrians has dissolved.


EXT.  BUS DEPOT.  DAY.

Row after row of parked buses.  TRUMAN and MARLON exit an
administration office.  Instead of heading for the exit, Truman
begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the
number painted on the rear of each one.

MARLON
What're you doing?
(gesturing to the office)
The man told you there's no such bus.

TRUMAN
He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was
definitely the number.

Marlon stops walking.  Truman continues his inspection.  Seeing
there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up.

TRUMAN
I never believed he was dead.

MARLON
(trying to be patient)
C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find
a body.  You know what the currents are like
in that water.

TRUMAN
(shudders, a memory
flashing in his head)
You had to see his face when that wave hit.
He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he
was expecting it, waiting for it.  He
knew it was coming.

MARLON
Why would he fake it?
(trying to make light)
He's not Elvis Presley.

TRUMAN
(ignoring the joke, pondering
the morning's events)
You know what was really strange about today?
An old woman with a little dog and a
businessman, walking in opposite directions
on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.
They force him onto a bus against his will,
a bus that doesn't normally stop outside
my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the
bus never makes another stop and I get the
feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians
are working together to make sure I never
catch up with it.

MARLON
(sarcastic)
Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and
the buses and the cars?  What are you
saying, the entire population of Lower
Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding
out that your father staged his death to
pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah,
that makes sense.

Truman has no answer.  We see an aerial shot of Truman and
Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of
buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.  They
have come to the last bus in the final row.  Truman hangs his
head.  The offending bus is not amongst them.  He makes towards
the exit without comment and Marlon follows.

Unseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the
buses they have previously checked - "2400".  A single drip of
black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.


EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

TRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of
Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked
behind them.

TRUMAN
You think I imagined it, don't you?

MARLON
I think you're missing your dad.
(trying to be delicate)
The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?

Truman is surprised Marlon remembered.  Marlon nods to the
sidewalk.

MARLON
You got sand in your cuffs.

Truman looks down at his feet.  A small, tell-tale pile of sand
has poured out of his tight trouser cuff.

TRUMAN
Maybe you're right.  If only the old
woman hadn't left her dog behind.

We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the
Lower Manhattan street.  It confirms that the old woman's DOG
was abandoned on the sidewalk.


INT.  TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.  DAY.

TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy.
doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties,
prematurely grey.  Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER
is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.  Truman and
Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.

RAQUEL
Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just
got her off to sleep.

TRUMAN
It was Dad. I swear.

Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.

RAQUEL
Well, the next time he shows up. bring
him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a
word about this to Mom and neither are you.

TRUMAN
If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you
think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?

RACQUEL
I know a reason he'd want to hide from you.
Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes
away, we hardly see you from year to year and
then you turn up with this story so insane you
don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you
hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you.

TRUMAN
(incredulous)
I was seven years old!

RAQUEL
But you're here and he's not.  Has it really taken you
this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?

TRUMAN
I'm telling you he's alive!

RAQUEL
(snapping back bitterly)
And I'm telling you he's fish food!

Truman meets her unforgiving eyes.  Without another word, he
walks out of the apartment.

Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out.
CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close
to Truman without being detected.  Raquel's demeanor immediately
changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears
younger, posture more upright, almost a different person.
Christof hugs Raquel.

CHRISTOF
You did well.


INT.  DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical
mirrored make-up tables.  At the only occupied table, Truman's
contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless
disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the
watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.

From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE
also take in the proceedings.  Behind their heads, a monitor
shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in
his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.

CHLOE
We've tightened security.

Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.

CHLOE
(referring to Kirk)
Why would he do this to us?

CHRISTOF
Old age.  Sentiment.  You play someone's
father all those years, you are someone's
father...He sees the way Truman is.  He
feels responsible.

Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony,
containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR.  Chloe follows.
Christof plays the cued recording without comment.  We focus on
the screen.


EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
water of Long Island Sound.  Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven
years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time,
acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy.
Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.

YOUNG CHRISTOF
(barking instructions to Kirk)
...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...

Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.

YOUNG CHRISTOF
The freak wave will strike from the
starboard side.  Remember, you don't
go to the diver.  The diver goes to you.

To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on
the side of the dinghy to capsize it.  Kirk and the boy are
tossed into the water.  While the boy immediately bobs to the
surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface.  After a long
moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away.
now wearing a spare aqualung.

YOUNG CHRISTOF
...Good!  Good!...of course, on the day you
only surface once you're safely beyond the
cove...Try it one more time...You okay?

Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned
boat.  Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing
participant in the masquerade.

The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain
face.


INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp.  TRUMAN
looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty
trunk under a canvas sheet.  The trunk is fastened with a
combination lock.  He deftly dials the correct combination and
opens the lid.

Inside, mementoes from his youth.  A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a
stack of "GREAT EXFLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a
garment in a drycleaning bag.  Truman carefully lifts up the
plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated
with pearl beading.  He puts the cardigan to his nose and
breathes deeply.

Footsteps.  Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and
shuts the lid.  MERYL, standing close behind.

MERYL
What're you doing out here?

TRUMAN
(turning attention to an upturned
mower on the garage floor)
Fixing the mower.

Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.

MERYL
(concerned)
Your sister called.  She was worried about you.

TRUMAN
(matter-of-fact)
I saw my father on State Street dressed as
a homeless man.

MERYL
(attempting to comfort)
I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.

TRUMAN
(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
What do you want?

MERYL
I made macaroni.

TRUMAN
I gotta go out.  About a replacement...
(hastily adding)
...mower blade.

Meryl nods, not at all convinced.  After an uncomfortable
pause, she turns and heads back to the house.


EXT.  CAR WASH.  DUSK.

TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly
washed Oldsmobile.  In the background is the warning sign he
has just ignored, "CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS".

Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender
cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the
severed aerial.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides
with PEDESTRIANS.  As he drives, he tests his car radio.
Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.

FEMALE VOICE (from radio)
...west on Atlantic...he's making a right
on Woodhaven...

Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds
that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio.
Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.

MALE VOICE (from radio)
...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's
on the move again, passing the Burger King...

Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly
there is a piercing blast of feedback.  He looks up and, as far
as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER
along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right
ear at exactly the same moment.

MALE VOICE
(from radio, in distress himself)
...something's wrong.  Change frequencies...

Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
success.


EXT.  DRUG STORE.  DUSK.

Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits
a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.  Out of the corner
of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right
ear with his finger.  He goes to say something to the by-stander
but thinks better of it.


EXT.  REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.  NIGHT.

HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares.
TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of
the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each
is by-passed.

Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy,
prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.  She is in
deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.  Veronica recognizes
the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.

VERONICA
Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin
cheatin' on me?

Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger
seat.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

VERONICA knows the form.  As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb,
she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the
drycleaning bag on the back seat.  She drapes the cardigan
around her shoulders.
VERONICA
Bout time you got this thing cleaned.
(half-joking)
Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady
wear it.

Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.  Veronica
removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.

VERONICA
(examining the bottle)
God, do they still make this stuff?
What's the Sell-By Date?


INT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  NIGHT.

From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park.
CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park
grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe,
the Unisphere.  Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a
miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up
picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.

CHLOE
(into a flip-phone,
condescending)
...you see him messing with the antenna...what
did you think would happen?..."lapse of
concentration", is that what you call it?
I call it amateur-hour...
(sarcastic)
In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to
do it over.

Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant
with affection and even a mild amusement.

CHLOE
(as she hangs up, querying the
smile that plays around his lips)
You think this is funny?

CHRISTOF
The mask has slipped before.  Everything
can be explained.

TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car
unaware that they are being observed.

CHRISTOF
(adopting a more serious tone
as he returns his attention to Truman)
What's dangerous is that he makes the connection
between what happened today and the girl.

We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge
of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.

VERONICA
Like I say, I don't normally do this.
I gotta charge extra.

Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills.
Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as
modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.

When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her
shoulder.  Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in
her role.  She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the
nape of his neck.  Slowly both heads drift together, but stop
just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.  So close
they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight
separating them.  Then finally their lips touch in the most
gentle of caresses.

They hold the kiss for another long moment and then
simultaneously break.  As they look into each other's eyes,
Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing
a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the
cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.

From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement,
triggering a flashback in his head.


INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be
playing on a television screen.  However, on this occasion it is
also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the
tower above the park.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
He's re-created the event on and off for a
number of years.  We've never understood what
prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that
matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy
to approach her in the first place...

A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies
LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender,
beaded cardigan at her open locker.  She is entertaining two
GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We'd noticed them making eyes at each other
for some weeks but never thought he'd say
anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry,
way out of his league...

Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the
lockers.  The three girls look up, surprised by the
interruption.

TRUMAN
(to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)
Hi.

GIRLFRIEND 1
(to Lauren as the two girlfriends
abruptly depart)
See you in class.

Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.

TRUMAN
Lauren, right?

Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her
text books.

LAUREN
No.

TRUMAN
(ignoring her lack of interest)
Look.  I was wonder--

LAUREN
--I can't go out with you.

TRUMAN
I haven't asked you yet.

LAUREN
Well when you do, that's my answer.
(softening)
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

TRUMAN
(summoning up courage from somewhere)
Why, you married?

Lauren smiles despite herself.

TRUMAN
I'm not asking you to have my children,
just a pizza.  How about Saturday?

LAUREN
(adamant)
No.

TRUMAN
Friday?

Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.

LAUREN
Now.

TRUMAN
Right now?  We got finals.

LAUREN
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

Truman hesitates.

LAUREN
(impatient, looking anxiously around)
Well, what do you want to do?

THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT
SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.


EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  DUSK.

The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the
Unisphere.  The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't
been properly coached, but we were torn...
He'd summoned the courage to make the
approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of
course she took full advantage...

Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding
the steel sculpture.

LAUREN
I never knew this place existed.

They both stare down at the inviting water.  Lauren suddenly
throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another
thought.  She comes splashing to the surface.  Truman stares
down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.

LAUREN
Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful!

TRUMAN
(nervous)
I...I can't.

Lauren suddenly stops splashing.

LAUREN
That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.

She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.

TRUMAN
(confused)
Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.
Has someone been talking to you?

Lauren wrings out her dress.

LAUREN
(to the sky, upset)
Get me out of here.  I don't want to
be here.

Lauren starts walking away.

TRUMAN
(confused, calling after her)
What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren!

Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing
her to face him.

LAUREN
(distraught)
My name's not Lauren!  It's Sylvia!

Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.

THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND
RETURNS TO NORMAL.

TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder
of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as
Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.  As we
have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great
delicacy.  Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips
with her finger.

SYLVIA
In a minute someone's going to come and
stop me talking to you.

TRUMAN
(looking around the deserted park)
Who?  There's no one around.

SYLVIA
(covering his lips once again)
You remember when you were a little boy,
you stood up in class and said you wanted
to be an explorer like Magellan.  And your
teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too
late, Truman.  There's nothing left to
explore."  And all the other kids laughed.
And you sat down.

TRUMAN
(incredulous)
How do you know about that?

SYLVIA
It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about
that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just
because something happens, doesn't mean you
can't take another chance in your life.

TRUMAN
I don't understand.

SYLVIA
(looking over her shoulder nervously)
There isn't much time.  Just listen.
Everybody's pretending Truman.  Everybody
but you.
(pointing to the
buildings on the horizon)
Look at that project.  You think anybody
lives there?  It's all for you, Truman.
A show.  The eyes are everywhere.

TRUMAN
(protesting)
Eyes?  Where?

SYLVIA
(frustrated, raving)
Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're
going to fill your head with lies.
You've got to make yourself deaf, you
understand?  When you're afraid the most, it
means you're on the right track.  Trust that
boy.  Promise me you'll do that?

Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.

Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of
nowhere.

SYLVIA
(scared)
I told you, Truman!

The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of
dark hair jumps from the car.  The man yanks the frightened
Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.

TRUMAN
(shocked)
Hey!

MAN
(to Sylvia)
Get in the car, Lauren!

Truman jumps up.

TRUMAN
(to the Man)
Who are you?!

MAN
I'm her father!

SYLVIA
No he's not!  He's just saying that!
Does he look anything like me?!

TRUMAN
Shut your mouth!

The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles
her into his car.  Truman rushes at the man.

TRUMAN
Leave her alone!

The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground.
He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth.

MAN
(to Sylvia)
I told you not to come here anymore!
(to Truman, who is getting
to his feet)
Which one are you?

Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back
into his head.

SYLVIA
(calling out from the car)
Don't listen to him, Truman.  Make yourself
deaf.  Come find me.

MAN
(to Truman, getting into the car)
Don't bother!  We're moving to Australia.
New York's done something to her head.

The Plymouth roars away.  Truman stares after it and then
turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he
have said New Jersey?


EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW.  DUSK, PRESENT DAY.

VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.

VERONICA
You want me to do it again?  I think I
could do it better.

TRUMAN
(coming back to reality)
No...thank you.

Truman picks up the cardigan.  They return to the car.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf.  She smokes a
cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.

TRUMAN
Veronica, what do you know for sure?

VERONICA
For sure?
(taking a long drag on her cigarette
as she gives the question due
consideration)
The nuns at my school, they used to say,
"The whole of life is faith."

Truman regards his companion in a new light.  He comes to a stop
at the corner where he picked her up.

VERONICA
(giving Truman an affectionate
peck on the cheek)
On the house.


INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

Another televised flashback.  The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN
stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We removed all physical trace of her
but we couldn't erase the memory...

ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS
TO NORMAL SPEED.


INT.  HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.  DAY

In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's
magazines.  By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.
nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to
improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.

The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.  He toys with
several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.
He stares wistfully at the completed picture.

ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD


INT.  SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DAY.

SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door.  His older
sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)
When he decided to go after Sylvia, we
were forced to intervene once again...

TRUMAN
(excited)
I've got something to tell you, Sis.

RAQUEL
(adopting a low, serious tone)
I've got something to tell you too.

TRUMAN
(unable to contain his news)
I'm going to Australia.

RAQUEL
Mom's real sick.

Truman's face falls.  As he enters the bedroom where his ill
MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE
STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his
hands.

THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH
THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT

TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of
his own driveway and kills the car's engine.  In the light of a
streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed
photograph of his wife, MERYL.  But he turns his wife's face
away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.

Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA
we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by
the years.  With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a
handful of paper fragments from his jacket.  Noses.  He tests
the likeness of each one in turn.  Unsatisfied that any of the
new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car
window.  We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as
Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.


EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

Close up on a nose.  We pull back to reveal that the nose
belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite
picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.
She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted
windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the
high-water line.  In the background, a solitary, white
beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.

Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece
of paper carried on the ocean breeze.  The paper catches on the
mast of one of the sailing dinghys.  A page from a newspaper,
carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
encountered his father.  Sylvia retrieves the page.  The
article's headline reads, "TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT".

Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach
house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her
sweater.  The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on
the sand.  Sylvia waves cheerfully back.


INT.  BAR SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to
the BARMAN.  A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.

WAITRESS
She was willing to lose him if it meant he
could find himself.
(registering the barman's blank look)
Never mind.


EXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside
the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar
excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly
throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across
the parking lot and into the school.


INT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING.

TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.
It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the
corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open
classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied.

Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens'
voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and
bursts through the double doors.

The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape
of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on
tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the
machine in disbelief.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at
the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his
ritual search but his heart is not in it.

He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection
in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will
appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him.

However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself
that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office
building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of
reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a
building Truman passes every day.

As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and
exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating
security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security
are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and
delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.


Truman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently
past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.

SECURITY GUARD 1
(to Truman)
Can I help?

TRUMAN
(sneaking a glance at the
building directory)
I have an appointment at, er...Diamond
Enterprises.

SECURITY GUARD 1
They went bust.

The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind
and makes a dash for it.

He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing,
defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN
EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause
of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the
woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
car.

The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building.
Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that
the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with
no floors above the ground floor.

The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other
elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on
folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary
curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator
cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn
stares back, appalled.

The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take
him by the arm.

SECURITY GUARD 1
You gotta leave.

TRUMAN
(riveted by the equally-stunned
building occupants)
What're they doing?

SECURITY GUARD 2
You gotta leave.

The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an
Emergency Exit.

TRUMAN
(not going quietly)
Just tell me what the hell's going on?

SECURITY GUARD 1
We're re-modelling.

TRUMAN
Like fuck!  What're they doing?


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the
street.

TRUMAN
You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!

SECURITY GUARD 2
Investigate what?  You're trespassing!

Truman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His
shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought
occurs to him.

He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another
building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground
floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK
STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or
were they expecting him?

Truman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors
show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing
of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the
stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.

OFFICIAL
You can't--

TRUMAN
(anticipating his response)
--I know.

Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down
the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every
building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD
anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED
FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.

He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing
attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around,
trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away.
Truman stops still, his head reeling.


INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe
the glass building down the street.  He ponders the black,
mirrored box.  LAWRENCE appears at his side.

TRUMAN
You ever been into the AMT Building?

LAWRENCE
(following Truman's gaze)
Not since they begun reconstruction.
(referring to the file
in Truman's hands)
What're you doing with that?

TRUMAN
(defensive)
I'm going to visit a site.

LAWRENCE
What for?

TRUMAN
Because I never do.

LAWRENCE
(placing a hand on Truman's arm)
That's why we got adjusters.

TRUMAN
(looking at Lawrence's hand
on his arm)
You got a problem with me going?

LAWRENCE
I got a problem with you not doing your job,
Burbank.  You already screwed up once this week.

TRUMAN
Let me worry about that.

Truman exits with the report.  After waiting only a matter of
seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.

As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges
from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.   They
approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.

LAWRENCE
680 West 89th.

Christof nods.  Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.


INT.  INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.  DAY.

An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of
the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path
with a large office desk they are attempting to transport.
Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning
clambers over the mahogany barrier.

MOVER 1
Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!


INT.  SUBWAY.  DAY.

TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other
frustrated passengers.  He loses patience and suddenly
turns and runs up the stairs.

INT.  TAXI CAB.  DAY.

TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no
apparent reason.

TRUMAN
(impatiently to driver)
Is there another way?  Can't you get around
this?


EXT.  A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.  DAY.

TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene.  A partially
burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.  Truman
checks the address on his file.  A small, serious-looking BOY
straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.

TRUMAN
(to the boy)
When was the fire?

BOY
(shrug)
Week ago.

TRUMAN
How come it's still smoking?

BOY
Started up again.
(dismissive)
Kids.

TRUMAN
(referring to his claims report)
Says here it burnt to the ground.

BOY
Wishful thinking maybe?

The boy is wise well beyond his years.  Truman fixes him with a
glare.

TRUMAN
Someone send you to tell me all this?

BOY
(unfazed)
You the one askin' questions.

The boy casually rides away.


EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.  We
sense, truly observing for the first time.

A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.  A YOUNG
WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.  An OLD MAN answers the
incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.  Nothing appears amiss.


EXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  DAY.

TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned
on Times Square.  Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of
vehicles flowing through the intersection.

Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out
into the traffic.  However as his foot is poised, the stream
of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to
be giving him a wider berth.  He steps off the sidewalk and.
to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth
without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle
will take evasive action.

Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of
the window of an electronics store.  He watches a local TV
news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.

However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own
face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the
store window.  He shudders at his video reflection.


INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.  We slowly
pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the
first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room
the size of a football field.

The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the
ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.
Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from
all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.
Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,
car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore
to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the
abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the
locations strangely devoid of people.

Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its
illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the
desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,
wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young
man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the
largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.

CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the
live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,
continuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the
background.

There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the
production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first
time.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a
microphone on the control panel.

CHRISTOF
...Everybody stay focused...remember who
you are...


EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.

A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and
carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.  Further down the
street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an
electrical repair in an exposed manhole.  A POSTAL WORKER does
his rounds.  An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping
bags.  Everybody appears natural, places to go.

Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN
at the only other occupied table at the cafe.  We see extreme
close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of
phoniness.  They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments
to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys.
Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.

Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he
has been fidgeting.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing
that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden
camera.  Truman suspects nothing.

He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime
run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.  Truman
happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.  He
springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.

CHRISTOF
(staring at the monitor)
Damn!

Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a
moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.


EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

TRUMAN
(to the jogger with
the familiar sneakers)
Small world.

JOGGER 1
(attempting to sidestep Truman)
Excuse me.

Truman blocks the man a second time.

TRUMAN
You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you
my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were
in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.

An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head
confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the
wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.

TRUMAN
(commenting ironically on his
new-found mobility)
A miracle!

JOGGER 2
(coming to his companion's aid)
Get the hell outta here.

The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table
causing him to stumble.


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.  DAY.

MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.
TRUMAN hurries up to him.

TRUMAN
Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.

MARLON
(surprised)
Truman!  Sorry, I'm up against it today.

TRUMAN
I've fallen over something, Marlon.
Something to do with my Dad. I think.

MARLON
(looking at him for the first time)
Are you okay? You look like shit.

TRUMAN
(ignoring the inquiries
about his health)
It's big, Marlon.  You wouldn't believe
who's in on it.

MARLON
(distracted)
In on what?

TRUMAN
There's no point trying to show you, they cover
their tracks too well.  But I've been going
into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta
familiar faces, y'know what I mean?

MARLON
(still engrossed in his own problems)
Something's definitely in the air.  My last
delivery, a kid got crushed to death.
tilting a vending machine.  They won't even
let me take the rest of the day off.

TRUMAN
Do it, anyway.

Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't
joking.

TRUMAN
I'm deadly serious. Marlon.  We can't talk
here.  I'm being followed.

MARLON
(suddenly concerned)
Who?

TRUMAN
I don't know.  They look just like regular
people.
(producing a notebook from
his jacket pocket)
But I've been writing down numbers - license
plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same
ones keep cropping up over and over.

MARLON
Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?  Cos I got
some friends here, they owe me.  We can lean back.
(pointing out a taxi
parked outside the yard)
Is he one of them?

TRUMAN
(anxious)
I don't know.  Could be.  One thing's certain.
The key is spontoneity.  Be unpredictable.
They can't stand that.  That's why we've got
to get outta here.  Can you come with me?

MARLON
(weakening)
Christ, Truman.  You're gonna get both our
asses fired.

Marlon shuts his van and gets in.  Truman enters the
passenger side.

MARLON
Where're we going?

TRUMAN
The beach.


INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives.  MOSES, a
contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking
and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man.  CHLOE hovers in the
background.  A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a
surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach
parking lot in Marlon's van.

The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control
facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware
of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.

CHRISTOF
(marveling, excitedly referring
to Truman on the monitor)
I can't believe how much he's shoved down.  That he
sensed the significance at aged seven and clung
to it so fiercely.

Roman paces, agitated, unimpressed.  Moses, mnore respectful.

CHRISTOF
(gesturing to the clifftop on the
monitor pointedly excluding Roman
from the conversation)
You remember, Moses, it used to end right
there, before the expansion.

ROMAN
(unable to contain his anxiety
any longer)
Christof, the cracks are starting to show.

CHRISTOF
(reassuring, keeping
himself in check)
I'll paper over them.

CHLOE
(coming to the defense of her mentor)
Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and
recovered.

ROMAN
(adamant, faintly hysterical)
No, not like this.  It's compromised.
Becoming unwatchable.

Too much for Christof.  He wheels on the young man.

CHRISTOF
Fear?  Doubt?  Is that what you have
trouble watching?  Perhaps you don't like
watching yourself.

Roman is stung into silence.

MOSES
(realizing his colleague is in
over his head, including Chloe
to save Roman's face)
Why don't you two wait outside?

Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video
wall.

CHRISTOF
(instantly more comfortable in the
company of a man his own age)
He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all.  We'll
get him back on.

MOSES
You know why they're so nervous.  The birth of
Truman's child is going to double revenue.
For God's sake don't let him upstage you.
(indicating Simeon through
the glass walls)
You've been grooming a successor.

CHRISTOF
He's not ready.

MOSES
Him or you?

CHRISTOF
(jaw setting firm, referring
to Truman on the monitor)
You can't pull him back in without me.
(more reflective)
He's just acting out of character.

MOSES
What if he's in character?  What if he's
starting to act in character at last?  Have
you ever considered that?


EXT.  LONG ISLAND BEACH.  DAY.

TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to
scale as a seven-year-old boy.


EXT.  CLIFFTOP.  DAY.

TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father
had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
earlier.  However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his
father described - almost identical to its neighbor.  MARLON,
laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.

MARLON
What're we doing here, Truman?

TRUMAN
This is where it started.

MARLON
Where what started?

TRUMAN
Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads.
False steps.  Slips of the tongue.

MARLON
(irritated)
Make sense, Truman.  You going religious on me?

TRUMAN
(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)
My father didn't want me to see what was over here.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.  I never shoulda
listened to him that day.  I knew it was wrong.

We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-
face twenty-seven years earlier.

TRUMAN
There were a hundred people on the beach that
day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me.

MARLON
I don't want to put you down but why would
anybody go to all this trouble over you?

TRUMAN
Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.
(a memory triggered)
A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a
copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said,
"Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

Marlon shrugs, unimpressed.

TRUMAN
A guy with the same name as me in Time
Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I
looked out for it.  But the day it came
out, every newstand was sold out.  No
library had it.  I even wrote off for a
back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day.

Marlon remains unconvinced.

TRUMAN
Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You
ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your
whole life has been building to something?

Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.  He hasn't had that feeling.

MARLON
(becoming testy)
A coincidence.  Haven't you ever heard
of a coincidence?

TRUMAN
I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em.
No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got
to get to the bottom of it.

MARLON
(shaking his head in exasperation)
Of what?!  Why're you doing this to yourself?

TRUMAN
I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell.
But I've never felt more alive.  It's just
like she said.

MARLON
(suddenly intrigued)
Who?

TRUMAN
It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here.

Now Marlon is really confused.

TRUMAN
Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.

MARLON
All I got on me is the takings from the machines.
Why do you need it?

TRUMAN
I'm going away for a while.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

The comfortably furnished room of a writer.  Walls lined with
books.  Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and
other reference material.  Sylvia's name on the spine of several
published volumes.  Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten
in blue ink.

SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.  As she
pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.  Truman's
missing copy of Time Magazine.  His face on the cover with the
headline,  "Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

Sylvia retrieves the magazine.  In front of a nearby mirror, she
holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment
imagining them together.  Then, catching herself, she quickly
lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his
television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of
"Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous".  MERYL, wearing her robe,
head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.

MERYL
(attempting to open him up)
What's going on, Truman?  You're not yourself.

TRUMAN
(vague)
Maybe you just don't know me very well.


INT.  DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining
room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.  Playing
silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance
shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.

CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner
companion - a woman her own age.  Christof's companion shrugs
resignedly.  Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised
resentment, enjoying the rivalry.

Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.  Christof
wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as
he gives the television his full attention.  A commercial for
"GLOBAL TRAVEL" begins to play.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

TRUMAN continues to watch "Lifestyles" restlessly.  However, as
he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his
chest towards his lap.

MERYL
We could do it right here, like we used to.

The program cuts to a commercial break.  The commercial
is for "Global Travel".

NARRATOR
(from television)
Travelling Down Under?  Global Travel is
turning rates to Australia upside down.  Round
Trip to Sydney only $829.  One way, $465.
Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...

Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is
elsewhere.

TRUMAN
(abruptly getting up)
Lemme go to the bathroom.

MERYL
Don't be too long.

Truman exits the living room.  However, on his way to the
bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table.  He surreptitiously
lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous
bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.


INT.  CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.

CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular
view overlooking the Hollywood Hills.  CHRISTOF rouses from his
enormous round bed.  His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving
coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly
perturbed by the intrusion.  Chloe switches on the television
set in the extravagent bedroom.  Playing on the set are TRUMAN
and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.

CHRISTOF
What happened overnight?

CHLOE
He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.

CHRISTOF
(smiling to himself)
God, that thing of his must be psychic.
(matter-of-fact)
He didn't masturbate?

CHLOE
Not for the last two inonths.

Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  MORNING.

MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to
find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.

MERYL
(rubbing ointment into her wrists)
Aren't you gonna be late?

TRUMAN
I got a call in the area.
(nodding to her wrists)
What's the case?  Anything interesting?

MERYL
(dispassionate)
Rape on the subway.

Truman's eyes widen.  We see a quick flashback in Truman's head
of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.

MERYL
They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.  No
witnesses.  Her word against theirs.
(picking up her bag to leave)
Maybe we could meet for lunch today.

Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door.
Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the
road and exits himself.


INT.  COURT BUILDING.  MORNING.

TRUMAN enters the courtroom building.  A crush of DEFENDENTS,
FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS.  Truman goes to enter
a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.

SECURITY GUARD
You a witness?

TRUMAN
Er, yes...
(suddenly losing heart)
No, no I'm not.

SECURITY GUARD
Closed session.

Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at
proceedings through the courtroom door window.

He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table.
A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY.  MERYL is
working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers
rapidly pressing the keys.  However, Truman notices a glaring
omission.  There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine.  The
roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.


INT.  TRAVEL AGENCY.  DAY.

The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
a last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their
clothes.  Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and
begin working.  As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER
looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.

Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a
female TRAVEL AGENT.  Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera
in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with
his hand.

TRUMAN
I wanna book a flight to Australia.

AGENT
Where exactly?

TRUMAN
(believing she is being
deliberately obtuse)
Australia.

AGENT
(a trace of condescension)
Where in Australia?  What city?

TRUMAN
Sorry, Sydney.  Sydney, Australia.  That's right.

AGENT
(entering the destination in her
computer)
For how many?

TRUMAN
(finding the question suspicious)
One.

AGENT
When do you want to leave, remembering, of
course, that you do lose a day on the way there?

TRUMAN
(more urgent than he intended)
Today.

AGENT
(reading off her computer screen)
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for a
week.

TRUMAN
(suspicious)
A week.

AGENT
(patiently explaining)
It's the busy season.

TRUMAN
(paranoia showing)
You sure you're not trying to keep me here?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Your
job is to help people travel, not keep 'em
where they are.
(pointing to the agent's
name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")
Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?

AGENT
(showing amazing restraint)
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship
departing for Australia tomorrow.  But you
wouldn't want to do that.

TRUMAN
Why wouldn't I?

AGENT
I thought you were in a hurry.

TRUMAN
(calming down)
That's right.

AGENT
You want to book the flight?

Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several
rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines.  The agent
looks askance at the pile of cash.

TRUMAN
You were expecting me, weren't you?

The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.

AGENT
It's non-refundable.


EXT.  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  DAY.

CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the
forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring
above them.  Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped
Sydney Harbor Bridge.

PROD. MANAGER
(unable to conceal his pride)
Happy?

Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.

CHRISTOF
(staring out at the pleasure
craft littering the harbor)
Can we contain him long enough?

PROD. MANAGER
I think so.

Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the
harbor.

PROD. MANAGER
(anticipating his next question)
He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to
disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him
out with complimentary cocktails, pull the
shades down during the movies.  He'll never know.

Christof gives another grudging nod of approval.  The Production
Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are
putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House.
CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.

CHLOE
(referring to the surrounding scene)
Why go to all the trouble?

Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN
sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.

CHRISTOF
He believes she has the answer.

CHLOE
Why not just tell him she's dead?

CHRISTOF
It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy
him.  He's going to have to find out for himself.
See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs
something genuine.
(rueful, all too aware
of the contradiction)
Even if we have to fake it.


INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.

"Please accept my resignation from
American Life & Accident, Inc. to
take effect immediately.

Yours tru"

TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a
fellow AGENT's desk.

TRUMAN
(to agent, picking up
a dictionary)
"Yours truly..."  You spell "truly"
"l...y" or "e...l...y"?

INSURANCE AGENT
I always write "Yours faithfully..."

Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at
the entry for a long moment.  He looks up, staring into the
middle distance.  His eyes widen as something clicks in his
mind.  Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.

LAWRENCE
Where the hell have you been, Burbank?
What the hell's going on?

TRUMAN
That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.

The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.

TRUMAN
I was just about to resign.  Isn't that
a laugh?  I just realized there's nothing
to resign from, is there?

LAWRENCE
Listen, don't bother with the resignation.
Just get the fuck outta here.

TRUMAN
(addressing the whole office)
Why're you all pretending?  Huh?
(gesturing to a computer terminal)
What is this a front for?  Why aren't I in
on the joke?  Was I away that day?!

Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer
off the desk to get their attention.  It lands on the floor with
an expensive crash.

TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I'm talking to you!  Who am I?!

LAWRENCE
(taken aback by the sudden violent act)
You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.

TRUMAN
(mimicking)
"Security!  I'm calling Security".

Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing
SYLVIA's hidden likeness.  Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence,
pinning him to a cubicle wall.

TRUMAN
You don't believe a single word you're saying!
(to the assembled group)
None of you do!
(suddenly talking to a sprinkler
head in the ceiling)
You hear me?!

We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV.
Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents
giving him a wide berth.  He shoves computers, desk lamps and
pot holders off desks as he goes.


EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe
again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the
dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him.  Behind
him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze.  The
sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast
day in New York City.

SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the
largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN
stuck in his car in gridlock.

SIMEON
(talking quietly into a
slim headset)
...and back to the close-up...

CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying
a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes
earlier.

CHLOE
(to a hard-bitten Operator, staring
at the dictionary)
Do you think he sees the entry?

OPERATOR
Hard to tell.

CHRISTOF
(sarcastic)
Why don't we ask him?

CHLOE
(snapping back, referring to the book)
I don't know how it got there!
(to Operator)
Enhance.

Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.
We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.

EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.  DAY.

TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.
On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an
INFANT in a baby carriage.

Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front
of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk.  He
has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come
to a halt.  Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant
from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.

The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds
the crying bundle in both hands above his head.

TRUMAN
(to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)
Say my name or I'll smash its head open.

The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.

TRUMAN
(vehement)
Say my name!

YOUNG MOTHER
(composing herself,
reaching out for her child)
Please, give him to me...

TRUMAN
(screaming above the baby's cries)
Say my name!  You know my name!  Say it!

YOUNG MOTHER
(bewildered)
I don't know you.

The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across
the street, watering his garden.  He drops his hose and hurries
towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man
stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in
the air.

TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I mean it!  I'm ready to do it!
What's my name?!!

Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can,
his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent
to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a
streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's
seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.

TRUMAN
(entreating the young
woman, tears in his eyes)
This is your last chance!

The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on
the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her
cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless.

TRUMAN
(his entire body shaking)
What...is...my...name?!

The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name.
Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go
through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself.
After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the
child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.

YOUNG MOTHER
(clutching the baby to
her breast, without thinking)
Thank you, Truman.

Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the
young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.

He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the
sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old
man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous
features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel
insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at
the streetlamps lining the roadway.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

A dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have
seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon
sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the
guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the
television set hidden away in an antique bureau.

SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she
sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches
her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes
the child's hand and leads him outside.


EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY.

TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.
doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.

TRUMAN
(referring to a distant
car on the expressway)
See that car way down there?  I bet it's a
Suburu station wagon.

Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car.
Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed.
Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game.

TRUMAN
I predict the next four cars will be a
white Honda Civic, a blue and white
Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,
a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender
and a motorcycle.

Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for
the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He
turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches.

TRUMAN
There's the Honda...the Dodge...here
comes the dented Beetle...

Meryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip.

TRUMAN
Look, damn you!

Following the VW is a school bus.

MERYL
(mocking)
Where's the motorcycle?

Truman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance
and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside.

TRUMAN
(yelling after her)
Don't you want to know how I did that?
Maybe you already know.  Is that it?

Behind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters.

MERYL
Where have you been?  I've been calling you
all day.

TRUMAN
Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name.
"Meryl".  I always liked it.

MERYL
(matching his sarcasm)
Nice of you to say so after eight years.

TRUMAN
Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your
real name?

MERYL
(rolling her eyes)
Oh, God.  What's got into you?

TRUMAN
Take a break. Meryl
(a knowing, almost foolish grin)
I know.

MERYL
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me...

TRUMAN
(irritated)
Drop it, I said.  It's over.

MERYL
(rambling on)
...we need more charcoal.

TRUMAN
Shut up!

MERYL
I'm gonna take a shower.

TRUMAN
(catching her wrist)
No.  We're going for a drive.

MERYL
What?!

Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door
and towards his car.

TRUMAN
(as he shoves her into
the Oldsmobile)
For years I've been saying I want to go
some place, well now I'm ready to go.  Let's
just jump in the car and go.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

TRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and
accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking.

TRUMAN
(as they speed down the suburban street)
I thought maybe, Atlantic City.

MERYL
(trying to mask her anxiety)
You hate gambling.

TRUMAN
That's right.  I do, don't I?

MERYL
So why do you wanna go?

TRUMAN
Cos I never have.  That's why you go places,
isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't
been curious since I was seven years old,
y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me
to the floor to keep me in one place.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track
Truman's speeding car.

CHRISTOF
How long to take Atlantic City out of
mothballs?

SIMEON
We could be up and running...three hours maybe.

CHRISTOF
Give me a number five gridlock on the
Jersey Turnpike.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New
Jersey Turnpike.  We observe the Oldsmobile on a television
lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.

TRUMAN
(a manic edge to his voice)
So much traffic, this time of day.  Does
that strike you as peculiar?

On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a
minor collision.

TRUMAN
(sneering at the sight of
the motorists)
Look at them.  You believe they're
fighting?  I don't believe it.
(shouting out the window
to the motorists)
Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?

Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.  But
his move is anticipated.  At the end of the offramp a pack of
cars suddenly appears.  Other vehicles fill the gap behind.

TRUMAN
(to Meryl, marveling)
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully
synchronized, don't you agree?

MERYL
(incredulous)
You blaming me for the traffic?

TRUMAN
Should I?

MERYL
You've never been on this road before.
You don't know what it's like.

TRUMAN
(manic)
That's true.  We could be stuck here
for hours.  Could be like this all the
way to Atlantic City.

Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.

MERYL
What the hell are you doing?

TRUMAN
You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm
sorry.  I don't know what got into me.

Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards
Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.

MERYL
Would you please slow down, Truman?

Truman floors the Oldsmobile.  The car flies past the exit for
Route 276.  He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.

MERYL
Truman, that was the turnoff!

TRUMAN
I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine
like this time of year?! I've never been to
Maine.
(Truman looks up through the
windshield at a helicopter
tracking his progress)
Or let's just see where the road takes us.

MERYL
(pleading)
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.
You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

TRUMAN
(eerily calm)
I think I'd like a little company.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's
progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically
circled to ease identification.  Christof jabs his finger at the
rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.

CHRISTOF
(to Simeon)
What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?
Keep them together.

SIMEON
(agitated)
They're rusty.  We can't keep up.
(rueful aside)
We don't know where he's going any more.

CHLOE
Oncoming is very thin.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either
side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of
moving traffic.

TRUMAN
(to the anxious Meryl at his side)
Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!  I don't
run into traffic.  The traffic follows me around.
(excited by his discovery)
We're in a moving pack, don't you see?

Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

CHRISTOF
(enthusing)
He's so close!  It's tantilizing!

CHLOE
You want to pull him over?

CHRISTOF
No police.  Not yet.  We shadow him.
We don't want him to panic.

CHLOE
He's trying to outrun the traffic.

CHRISTOF
He's trying to outrun the world.  Keep him
on this route.
(to Simeon who is consulting
someone on his headset)
Are we ready?

Simeon nods.  Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the
control room.  They hover nervously in the background.


INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.  DUSK.

TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars
at a police roadblock.  At the head of the line, the cars are
being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending
with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.

TRUMAN
(to Meryl)
It's hard to go places, isn't it?

MERYL
There's been an accident, Truman.  We
have to go back.

TRUMAN
No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.

Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.

TRUMAN
What's going on?

OFFICER
(grim-faced, indicating the nearby
Indian Point nuclear power plant)
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

TRUMAN
Is there any way around?

OFFICER
The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution.

Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all
of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.


EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path,
leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried
in their parents' arms.  Hanging back from the rest of the
group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back
to the house.  As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against
the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.

Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television
playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our
view.  She is unaware of the man's face at the window.

Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards
Sylvia with a resigned smile.  He mounts the bicycle and rides
back up the path.


EXT.  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  DUSK.

Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste
vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant,
the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.  TRUMAN flees the
car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.

MERYL
Truman!!  Come back!!

Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in
their protective suits carrying detection instruments.  The
workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off
his path to the power plant.  As he crests a slight rise beyond
the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.  However,
peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the
lights of a cityscape in the distance.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.

CHRISTOF
Did he see it?

CHLOE
I don't think so.

The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as
the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling
TRUMAN is being escorted away.  We see an aerial shot from the
helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.  Truman stoic,
tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.  Truman's airline ticket
torn to shreds on the table in front of them.

MERYL
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're
not well.

TRUMAN
(ignoring her tears and medical advice)
Why do you want to have a child with me?
You can't stand me.

MERYL
That's not true.

TRUMAN
(suddenly angry)
Don't lie to me!

Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.  Truman follows,
getting in her face.

TRUMAN
Tell me what's happening?!

MERYL
(frightened but remaining poised)
I thought you knew everything.  What could
I tell you?

TRUMAN
(backing her up against
the kitchen bench)
You're part of this, aren't you?!

Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect
herself.

MERYL
Truman, you're scaring me!

Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness,
grabs her wrist and disarms her.

TRUMAN
No, you're scaring me, Meryl!

Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her.
While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to
march her around the room, talking to the walls, light
fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.

TRUMAN
Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.
(to a lamp)
I know you can hear me.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN
looks directly into one camera lens after another.  ROMAN is the
first to crack.

ROMAN
(entreating Christof)
Get somebody in there!

CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
No.

SIMEON
(siding with the executive,
showing his true colors)
She's in trouble!  We've got to help her!

Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into
the microphone.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.  Unheard by TRUMAN,
from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.

CHRISTOF (O.C.)
He's bluffing.  Call his bluff.

MERYL
(in reply to the voice in her
head, half-strangled due to the
pressure of the knife)
Do something...

Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.  Sensing that she
too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to
read her face.

TRUMAN
(wild-eyed)
Who are you talking to?!

MERYL
(incredulous)
You're the one talking to the walls!

TRUMAN
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you
talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if
you don't tell me.

Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to
the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman
forces his way inside.  They both tumble onto the waterbed
causing it to rock back and forth.  Gripping Meryl's hair,
Truman throws aside the bed covers.

TRUMAN
(distraught, referring to the bed)
How could you buy this damn thing when you
know he drowned in front of me?!

Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl
begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.

TRUMAN
You have any idea what it's like to drown?

Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping
hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.  She
thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.

Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.

MERYL
(gasping for air)
Truman, stop it!
(to the ceiling)
Don't let him do it!

TRUMAN
(to a light fixture, threatening)
I'll kill her!

He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her
head down longer this time.  She continues to struggle.

Suddenly, the front door chimes.  Startled, Truman lets Meryl up
for air.

TRUMAN
(sneering at Meryl)
Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic.

Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats
her to it.  Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.

TRUMAN
(wincing in pain)
Damn!

At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the
front door.  The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more
insistently.

TRUMAN
(shouting through the closed door)
Stay where you are or I'll kill her!

MARLON (O.C.)
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.

Truman flinches.  He was so convinced it would be the police.
He takes a step back against the hallway wall.  Before he can
decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door
to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to
Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.

Marlon locks eyes on Truman.  Sizing up the situation, he slowly
but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.  Meryl
wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and
collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.

MERYL
(distraught, dropping character,
forgetting herself)
They were going to let him kill me!


EXT.  ABANDONED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end
of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.

TRUMAN
People know who I am, my every move, complete
strangers know my name.  Even when there's
no one around, I feel the eyes on me.

MARLON
(reluctant admission)
I was in the bank today.  The Federal on
Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody
named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that
the stranger you're talking about?

Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.

TRUMAN
(half to himself, refusing to accept it)
No.  No.  I've never seen her before.
(registering Marlon's skepticism)
I know you already think I'm going out
of my mind but I genuinely believe the
world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody
seems to be in on it.

MARLON
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure
that's not wishful thinking, you wishing
you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ,
Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had
an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?
Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

TRUMAN
That's just it.  I think I am somebody.

MARLON
(sympathetizing)
I used to dream all my friends and family
got together in a hotel room, thinking of
ways to fuck me up.

TRUMAN
Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes
I think it's for real.

Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
in the night.

MARLON
Tru, we've known each other since before
we could get a hard-on.

Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.

MARLON
The only way we ever made it through
high school was cheating off each other's
test papers.  Jesus, they were identical.
I always liked that, because whatever the
answer was, we was right together and we
was wrong together.

Truman nods fondly at the memory.

MARLON
The only night either of us ever spent
in jail, we spent together and I wet
myself but you never told anyone.
I was best man at your wedding and my
brother was best man at my wedding and
you didn't talk to me for a month over
that and I didn't blame you because you've
been more of a brother to me than he's
ever been.  And I never shoulda let
my Goddam father talk me into that.

Truman is slowly coming around.  Marlon's speech from the heart
soothing away his pain.

MARLON
I know things haven't worked out for
either of us like we used to sit up on
Freemont Street all night and dream they
would.  We all let opportunities pass us
by, none of us asks for the dance as
often as we should.  I know that feeling
when it's like everything's slipping away
and you don't want to believe it so you
look for answers someplace else.  But,
well, the point is, I would gladly step
in front of traffic for you.

Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.  We see
a close up of Marlon's ear.  From inside, unheard by Truman,
CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the
lines to Marlon, immersed in the role.

CHRISTOF
(hushed tones)
...and the last thing I'd ever do is
lie to you...

Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand
around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably
superior to Marlon's own delivery.

MARLON
(staring into Truman's
eyes, repeating the
words in his ear)
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.
(pause)
Think about it, Truman, if everybody's
in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.
I'm not in on it cos there is no it.

Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining
away.  Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug.

Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star
shines.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

From his chair, CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of
his COLLEAGUES.  The two executives, MOSES and ROMAN are at the
head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten.

CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug.

MARLON, accepting a towel from a P.A., still in wardrobe,
approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair.
grasping his hand.

MARLON
(leaving his head close to
Christof)
I can't thank you enough.  I don't know
what happened.  He was so close.  It threw
me.  I'm indebted.

Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and
Marlon withdraws.

Finally Christof's Assistant Director, SIMEON, approaches and
offers his hand.  Christof hesitates before shaking.  Simeon
returns to the monitors, now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or
Long Island.  Christof stares out the window to conceal an
expression of quiet vindication.


INT.  A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa
gazing straight ahead.  On the teievision in front of them,
a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him
broadcast to a viewer's set.

He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the
cameras recording him.

The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight
shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one
over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from
another angle showing the book's title, "To The Ends Of The
Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully
framing the "action" with the message, "FOLGERS Coffee - Good To
The Last Drop."  After several seconds, the border disappears.

Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the
screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around
the edge of the image.  Overlapping scenes from Truman's life
appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and
finally adulthood.  A graphic, "TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human
Life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory
narration.

NARRATOR (O.C.)
You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of
A Human Life".  Everything that occurs here
is real.  There are no re-creations or
interruptions.  Due to the live and unedited
nature of the program, viewer discretion is
advised.

The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER, mid-fifties,
conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry
King-style interview setting.  Projected in the background is
the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book.


INT.  STUDIO.  NIGHT.

INTERVIEWER
(to camera)
Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have
been a more momentous week in the show's
history.  I'm your host, Michael Conners, and
this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the
forum where we discuss and analyze recent
events with the show's award-winning creator
and producer, Christof.
(referring to the image
of Truman in the background)
I remind viewers that as this is a living
history, it is our practise to keep the image
of Truman on screen at all times.
(turning to Christof)
Welcome.

CHRISTOF
Thank you.

INTERVIEWER
Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in
ratings over the last few days, how do you hope
to sustain that audience now that Truman appears
to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?

CHRISTOF
Ratings have never been our primary goal.  I
imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested
in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However
I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.

INTERVIEWER
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does
raise the perennial question.  What keeps us
watching one man twenty-four hours a day -
eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in
contemplation?

CHRISTOF
It has to be the reality.

During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa, the
BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christof's theories on
their viewing habits.

CHRISTOF
We've become increasingly frustrated watching
actors give us phony emotions, bored with
pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the
world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's
nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts.
no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but
it's genuine.  That's how he can support an
entire channel.

INTERVIEWER
A window onto the human condition?

CHRISTOF
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.  Not only
does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he
gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

INTERVIEWER
But how do you account for the popularity of
those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

CHRISTOF
We find many viewers leave him on all night
for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your
child or your lover sleep?

INTERVIEWER
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
desk's high-tech phone terminal.

INTERVIEWER
(into speaker phone)
Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.

MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
Hello?

INTERVIEWER
You're on, caller.  Go ahead.

MALE CALLER 1
Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.

CHRISTOF
Thank you.

MALE CALLER 1
Truman has never been closer.  The way he looked
directly at us, spoke to us for the first time.
Do you think he'll ever work it out?

CHRISTOF
I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his
world, as we all do at certain times, and
eventually it passed the test.  You have to
understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world
he occupies his only frame of reference.
No, for him to come even this close to the
truth is a remarkable testament to his
instincts.

The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal.

INTERVIEWER
Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".

MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)
How much of a strain has the last few days
placed on the actors?

CHRISTOF
Working on "Truman" has always been a huge
commitment for an actor, not just in terms
of separation from friends and family, but
since Truman essentially drives the plot,
it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent
events have raised the pressure but also the
prestige.

INTERVIEWER
(cutting off the call)
Of course Truman has always been very much in on
casting.

CHRISTOF
As with our own lives, the only people he can't
cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final
approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead
role as was the case with his only real friend,
Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
player.

INTERVIEWER
(pressing another line)
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned
videographer, Christof.

MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)
Christof.  I've admired your work my whole life,
although I can't say I've seen it all.

CHRISTOF
Who can?

MALE CALLER 3
Can you settle an argument for me?  What's
the longest time Truman has been off-camera?

CHRISTOF
(trace of pride)
In his entire life, forty-two minutes.  A
technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of
that time.  The remainder generally results
from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman
would stray out of range of our cameras.

INTERVIEWER
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.
(pressing another line)
Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".

FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?

CHRISTOF
(sensing the thinly disguised
resentinent in the caller's voice)
I believe that to be so.  I often feel the only
difference between Truman's life and our own
is that his is being more thoroughly documented.
We all play our allotted roles--

FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
--He's not a performer.  He's a prisoner.

The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof
holds him back.

CHRISTOF
(rising to the challenge)
--He can leave at any time.  If his was more
than just a vague ambition, if he were
absolutely determined to discover the truth,
there's no way we could prevent him.  I think
what really distresses you, caller, is that
ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--

FEMALE CALLER 1
(as if trying to convince herself.
giving herself away)
--No, you're wrong!  He'll prove you wrong!
He can still do it!

CHRISTOF
(a thought occurring, looking
directly into camera)
Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

SYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off
the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen.

It is she who is the Female Caller.  Christof seems to stare
back at her as the talk show continues.

INTERVIEWER
(from television)
Recording a human life from birth to death,
that's still the intention?  You still believe
Truman has more to contribute?

CHRISTOF
(still reflecting on the last call)
More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to
witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing
us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope.

INTERVIEWER
Let's take another call.
(pressing a line)
London, England you're on "Tru Talk".

FEMALE CALLER 2
By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,
but has the recent violence and profanity
caused a problem for the sponsors...?

Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on
the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book.

She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.  She
has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.  With a look of
resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name
on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.


INT.  MASTER TAPE ROOM.  NIGHT.

Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire,
cavernous room - "Truman" and a date on the spine of each
cassette.  Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live
picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa.

Sitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by
Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb.

CHRISTOF (O.C.)
What are you looking for?

Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected
entrance.

CHLOE
(not taking her eyes from screen)
He was premature, wasn't he?

CHRISTOF
Only by two weeks.

CHLOE
Curious even then?  Like he couldn't
wait to get started?

CHRISTOF
(feeling out where the
conversation is headed)
His eagerness to leave his mother's womb
also meant he was the one selected.

CHLOE
What was it like, the first show?

CHRISTOF
The ultimate live television.  In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies - the
casting of a show determined by an air date
- he was the one who arrived on cue.

CHLOE
Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?
About letting him go if he wanted it badly
enough.  Would you really do that?

Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty.

CHRISTOF
It won't come to that.


INT.  OFFICE.  DAY.

The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss,
ERROL, sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk.  LAWRENCE
lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down.


INT.  BANK.  DAY.

TRUMAN approaches the bank window.  The teller is the YOUNG
WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street.  She takes a
step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the
confrontation fresh in her memory.

Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's
hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street.
He begins to apologize profusely.


INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

TRUMAN enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater.  He
breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it
in the trunk.  With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and
fastens the lock.


EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DUSK.

TRUMAN emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower,
deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house.

Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in
her hand, MERYL has been anticipating her husband's appearance.
She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman
than for any benefit she might derive.

Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the
mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section
of grass.  We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are
severed by the mower.  The lawn is now uniformly trimmed.

From a mechanical platform above the Expressway, CHRISTOF and
CHLOE watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.


INT.  OFFICE BUILDING, LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district,
a ROBOTIC MANNEOUIN in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story
window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour
traffic.  The PEDESTRIANS are all standing around, no one
walking.  Some are chatting with each other, others primping.
The cars, vans and taxis are also idling.

Camera locations are being checked.  A miniature camera
inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a CAMERA TECHNICIAN
waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the
eye of a MDDEL on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean,
the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is
placed on a BUSINESSMAN's double-breasted jacket by a TECHNICIAN
- we see from the button's POV, a CONTACT LENS CAMERA is
carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, LAWRENCE,
another TECHNICIAN we observe from the contact's POV.

Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building
and a TOURIST'S camcorder are positioned.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF is seated at the control desk, directing the morning
session, SIMEON assisting, CHLOE at his shoulder, a buzz of
excitement in the room.

CHRISTOF
I hope we've got fresh extras.

CHLOE
(consulting a clipboard)
The rotation was made this morning.

CHRISTOF
(staring at a monitor, irritated)
I don't like the couple with the baby.
They'd never be together.

The COUPLE with the stroller are promptly moved further along
the street.

CHRISTOF
Who's doing wardrobe?  I keep seeing the
same wardrobe...


INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  MORNING.

TRUMAN spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other
COMMUTERS.  We hear Christof's off-camera voice, as always
unheard by Truman.

CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...everybody back to One...

EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING

CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...and, action background...

At the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving
normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He
begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour
traffic.

CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...
let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept
together...everybody look like you've got places
to go...


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON,
from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director.

CHRISTOF
I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.

As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's
banner headline, "NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED".  Christof scans
the shot options available to him on the video wall.

CHRISTOF
...Bodycam Two...

The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view
of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware
Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.

CHRISTOF
...streetlight eight...

The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The
camera continues to follow Truman's progress.

CHRISTOF
...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One...

TRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by.

CHRISTOF
...and cut to interior...

Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside
the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an
ancient SECURITY GUARD.

CHRISTOF
...looser...

The camera widens the angle.

CHRISTOF
...and action, Vivien...
(aside, proud of his casting)
Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.

VIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at
the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after
Truman has already turned his back.

CHRISTOF
(incensed)
Damn, she missed her mark!
(impatiently to Simeon)
Why do we bother with walk-throughs if
nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot
of Truman and Vivien...go to the master
...hold the elevators...
(mustering patience, into microphone)
Vivien, press the elevator button again
...and make sure you catch his eye this time...


INT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY.

A second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like
clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator
button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator
car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she
sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a
piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF
Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior...

The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly
filling with co-workers.

CHRISTOF
...and Lawrence...

Just as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He
gives Truman a smug smile.

CHRISTOF
...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...

The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers.

LAWRENCE
(admiring aside to the remaining
fellow-males in the elevator)
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the
comely young woman.  He is miles away.


INT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are
several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON,
ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN,
sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast.

CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large
monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at
American Life plays silently behind Christof's head.

CHRISTOF
(to the meeting, referring to
Meryl by her real name)
Regrettably, I have to inform you that
Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.

All eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor.

CHRISTOF
I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.

Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit.

CHRISTOF
Her separation from Truman will be
orchestrated over the summer.
(more up-beat)
However, I'm pleased to announce that
television's first on-air conception will
still take place.  You witnessed the initial
contact this morning.
(glancing to Vivien, once
again using her real name)
You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.
Thankfully, Truman doesn't.

The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction.

CHRISTOF
(referring to the bound documents
CHLOE passes to each cast member)
This is a copy of Claudia's back story.
Her character's name will be Vivien.
She's the new adjuster at the office.

The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on
the cover, "NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET".

CHRISTOF
We intend to entice Truman into the
affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will
make her advance at the seminar Truman's
attending next week.  Details are in your
schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia
welcome.

MARLON
(injecting a note of levity, more
sophisticated than the character he plays)
Question is, will Truman make her welcome?

The cast snickers.

CHRISTOF
(immediately back to business)
I don't have to tell you, how critical
the next few weeks will be.  This takes us
into the next generation.  When Truman's
child is born, the network will be switching
to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.

VIVIEN
What happens when Truman and the baby are
both on camera together?

CHRISTOF
There will simply be duplicate coverage.

VIVIEN
(mischievous)
Let's just hope we don't have twins.

CHLOE
(uncharacteristically flippant)
When Truman dies do we go back to the
single channel?

The cast turn in her direction.  Christof has a second occasion
to question his Assistant's loyalty.


INT.  A BAR SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

The BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe
TRUMAN on the television above the bar.  The cameras track
Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.  As he ducks into a
sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.  Inside the
store, Truman appears apprehensive.

BARMAN
What's he doing in there?

PATRON
Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge.

On screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles.

WAITRESS
(referring to Truman's overcoat)
What's with the coat?

BARMAN
(smirking at the irony)
Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.

Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an
item to the floor.

PATRON
(remarking on Truman's clumsiness)
Nervous.

Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store,
the cameras following his journey as always.

BARMAN
(exasperated)
Oh God, he never bought nothing.

WOMAN
Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty-
four years to get the nerve to go in there.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT

We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several
pages long.  The kitchen itself is a bombsite.  More than the
cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked
haphazardly on the floor.


INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.  Blankets piled in a
heap.  Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the
room.  A chair in an odd position near the bed.  Clothes strewn
everywhere.  Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered.

TRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a
standard mattress.  Although he is completely covered from head
to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly
visible.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control
room.  It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom
filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras.
Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in
their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen.
Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.

SIMEON
...Ready two.  Go to two.

Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated
buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close
shot of Truman's covered head.  The camera stays on the
blanketed head for a long moment.

SIMEON
And back to the medium.

Another button is pressed and the angle changes.  A trace of
frustration is evident in the control room.  Recording a
sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness.

SIMEON
...and wide...

OPERATOR
(aside to Simeon)
Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?

SIMEON
(shrugs)
That loser pays our salary.

OPERATOR
He's given up on himself again.

SIMEON
Who cares?  Makes life easier for us.
He is what he is.

At the far end of the great room, one of the large double
doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE,
carrying a leather-bound folder.  Simeon and the Operators
subtely straighten in their chairs.  Christof pretends not to
notice.  He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor.

CHRISTOF
When did he start sleeping like that?

SIMEON
About the time Meryl left.

CHRISTOF
Is that the best shot we can get?

SIMEON
What's to see?

Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.

CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)
What happened to the room?

SIMEON
He started to reorganize.  I was going to
call you.  But half-way through, he gave
up and fell asleep.

Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator.

CHRISTOF
I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's
insurance convention.

Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches
up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.  They
show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.  A
banner in reception reads, "WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT".
The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
producer's attention has wandered.  Christof is staring at the
sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor.

CHRISTOF
Give me a shot from his wedding band.

SIMEON
(pointing out the ring on Truman's
bedside table)
He took it off.

CHRISTOF
(a trace of concern)
Why is he so still?  He's too still.

Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to
his ear.

CHRISTOF
Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.

An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.  Christof and
his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their
headphones.  Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that
nothing is amiss.  Christof is not so easily convinced.

CHRISTOF
Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso.

A camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's
prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body
does not rise and fall.

CHRISTOF
(anxious, barking a command to Chloe)
Phone him.

Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.

CHRI STOF
(anticipating Chloe's question)
Wrong number.

The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head,
begins to ring.  Truman doesn't flinch.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a
late night swim.  Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes
to pick it up.  However, after lifting the receiver, the phone
continues to ring.

The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau.
On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call.
Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated.

CHRISTOF
(a trace of panic)
He didn't drink tonight?  No pills?

Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in
reply.

CHRISTOF
Hang up!

Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone
ceases to ring.

CHRISTOF
Get Marlon over there.

CHLOE
Under what pretext?

CHRISTOF
(letting his anxiety show)
Any fucking pretext!

Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing.


EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

MARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house.
Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he
dashes barefoot to the front door.  He tries the doorhandle,
pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously,
shouting Truman's name all the while.

MARLON
Tru!..Tru!..

Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the
window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but
his shouts fail to rouse him.  Marlon picks up one of Meryl's
carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window.

MARLON
(shouting a warning)
I'm comin' in, Tru!

Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower
of glass over Truman's bed.  Still he doesn't move.  Marlon
reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the
window frame and unlatches the window.


NT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands
in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed.

He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally
stands at his co-star's bedside.  There is a hissing sound.
Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.  Beneath the bedding is a
life-size inflatable female doll.

The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly
deflating.  Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable
tape recorder.  Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next
to his ear.  The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

CHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor
of MARLON and his bizarre companion.  Marlon is frozen, staring
into camera.

CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
Cut transmission.

Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.  He looks to
Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an
"EMERGENCY" button.

CHRISTOF
(enraged)
I said, "Cut"!

Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on
her television screen is replaced by the "TRUMAN" logo and the
message, "TECHNICAL FAULT.  PLEASE STAND BY."


INT.  CONTROL ROOM NIGHT.

CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.  On the bank
of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS
systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's
home and neighborhood.  Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear
in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt.

While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card,
Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor
playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner.
It is a recording of the night's transmission.  Simeon stops on
the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN.

They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and
climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers
over his head.  As the light is switched off, the recording
camera automatically switches to night vision.  Simeon continues
to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast-
forward mode.  Christof suddenly points to the screen.

CHRISTOF
There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair...

Simeon types the appropriate command.

CHRISTOF
Enhance.

On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg,
it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls
commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement
already positioned in the bed.

CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris)
He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering
a blind spot.

CHLOE
How does he know where the cameras are?

CHRI STOF
I don't know.
(noting the time-code on the monitor,
staring into the back of Simeon's head)
All I know is we've been filming a blow-up
doll for the last three hours.

Simeon feels the hostility.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

The systematic search of the monitors continues.  They now
reveal that dawn has broken on the set.

SIMEON
(hanging up the phone)
We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras
required for the search are on the set.
Everyone else is at first positions.

CHRISTOF
All prop cars accounted for?

SIMEON
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's
most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room
with a status report.

CHLOE
The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug
if we don't make a statement within the next
hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone
lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot
of Harlon and the dummy.


EXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY.

TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his
clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud.

He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a
shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags.
Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his
shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn.


EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY.

TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge.
Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car
approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car.

Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in
the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER
looking straight into Truman's blackened face.

POLICE OFFICER
Any sign of him?

TRUMAN
(deliberately gravelling his voice)
Not yet.

The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what
seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on.

POLICE OFFICER
(to Truman, as the car pulls away)
Take it easy.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY.

We pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually
bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted.

Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street.
Then another and another.

PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching
down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted
at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS
linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES
and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS,
HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE
OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we
glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst
the searchers.

A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search
is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the
searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such
as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and
shrubbery.

We focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked
arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up.

A swarm of helicopters fills the sky.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has
been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and
ROMAN.

MOSES
(to Christof who is still studying
the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)
Rumors are circulating he's dead.

ROMAN
(pacing nervously)
The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.

CHRISTOF
(unconcerned, referring to the static
"STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by
soothing classical music)
Why?  We're getting higher ratings for
that graphic than any time in the series.


INT.  BARROOM.  DAY.

The television behind the bar carries the still graphic.
BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks.
Some place bets with each other over the outcome.


EXT.  ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY.

A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions
in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments.


INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the
graphic on their televisions.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to
make another sweep.

CHLOE
(referring to the empty streets)
When we flush him out how do we explain this?

CHRISTOF
(deadpan)
We tell him the truth.

Chloe looks askance at Christof.

CHRISTOF
(joking darkly)
We're making a movie.

SIMEON
(hopeful)
We'll get him on this next sweep.

CHRISTOF
What have we missed?

SIMEON
It's just a matter of time.

CHRISTOF
No.  We've missed something.

Christof turns his back on the screens.  Over his shoulder,
we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor.


EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.  DAY.

TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the
pretext of taking a leak.  He is standing on the edge of
Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning
their next sweep.  Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green
and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street
Racquet Club.

We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened
face, staring down at the lapping water.  It triggers a montage
of flashbacks.  As usual the images all appear to play on a
television screen.

TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade
teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at
his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY
TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his
WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the
UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness.


EXT.  PIER 13.  DAY.

TRUMAN comes back to reality.  He steels himself, shuts out the
doubts and dives into the water.


EXT.  NEW YORK HARBOR.  DAY.

Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold
sea, arms and legs flailing.  Suddenly he stops and sinks for a
moment in the weight of his clothes.  Then slowly he rises to
the surface and begins to swim.

Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus'
flagship, The Santa Maria.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history
of "TRUMAN" on a preview monitor.

He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain
in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season.
Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.  Christof presses
"PLAY" on the mixing desk.

SYLVIA
(from monitor)
You remember when you were a little boy...

Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again.

SYLVIA
...Trust that boy...

Christof jabs the "PAUSE" button, freezing the picture.  He
recites the words to himself.

CHRISTOF
Trust that boy...
(to Simeon)
We're not watching the sea.

SIMEON
(confused)
Why would we?

CHRISTOF
Sweep the harbor.


EXT.  NEW YOUR HARBOR.  DAY.

TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her
sails.  Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's
composite picture.

His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.  As the archaic
vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge
appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.  Truman steers
around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the
horizon.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on
a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea.
Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched
against the horizon.

SIMEON
That's him!

CHRISTOF
Resume transmission.

Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is
instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the
classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the
sound of a helicopte's rotor blade.

Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight
of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF
(staring intently at the On-Air monitor)
What do we have on that boat?

Simeon scans a computer shot list.  He types in a code.  A
camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.  Truman,
unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel.


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising
and falling beneath his boat.  He nears a large buoy bobbing
clumsily in the strong swell.  An official-looking sign is
attached - "DANGER.  NAVAL EXERCISES.  DO NOT ENTER."  We see an
extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised
miniature camera tracks Truman's progress.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the
buoy's POV as he sails by.


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.  By now the ocean spray has
washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains.
The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open
coat, are soaked.  Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass.

As he steers, he occasionally refers to a "HOW TO SAIL" book
from his coat pocket.  He tacks against the wind, as he watches
the military chopper circle his boat.

CHOPPER PILOT
(over P.A.)
Alter course immediately.  You are
entering a restricted area.

Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper.

TRUMAN
Fuck you!


EXT.  A STREET SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

Two YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image
of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV.

YOUNG MAN 1
I knew he wasn't dead.


INT.  HELICOPTER.  DAY.


The HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle.

PILOT (over P.A.)
Alter course or we fire on your vessel.

TRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the
pilot.

TRUMAN
Get the hell away!  It's my life!


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF
(into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)
Fire a warning.


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows
of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.  TRUMAN
flinches.  In his eyes we see the ghosts return.  With great
effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare
gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house.

CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)
Alter course.  Drop your sails.

Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.  The
distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly
missing.  Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

SIMEON
(shocked at the near miss)
Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind?

CHRISTOF
(composed, into microphone to pilot)
Pull back.


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a
second time and fires.  The distress flare fishtails into the
sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark,
striking the rear rotor blade.  Truman lets out a whoop.

The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards
the sea.  The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing
down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves
in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like
a stone.  Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in
their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's
head.  He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering
away from the drifting pilots.  A look of resolve in his eyes we
have never witnessed before.


INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.  As
Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture
still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief
moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the
control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY.

CHRISTOF
How long will another chopper take?

SIMEON
By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.

CHRISTOF
We have to stop him for his own good.
Turn him back with the elements.

SIMEON
(hesitant)
There's no rescue boat in the area.  He
won't know what to do.

MOSES
(trying to appeal to Christof's
sense of reason)
For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world
is watching.  We can't kill him in front
of a live audience.

CHRISTOF
He was born in front of a live audience.
(never taking his eyes from
the screen, reassuring)
Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life
for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back.

Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk
marked "WAVE", "WIND" and "RAIN".  After typing in a command, he
winds the controls towards their maximum settings.

CHRISTOF
Kill the lights.

Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom
she has believed for so long.


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's
boat at an alarming speed.  High winds buffet the boat.  TRUMAN
fights the wheel.  Hurricane force winds shake the masts and
keel, ripping the sails to shreds.

The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the
sea.  His "HOW TO SAIL" book skids off the deck.

Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes
himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.

TRUMAN
(shouting above the storm)
I'm coming to find you Sylvia!  I'm making
myself deaf!
(screaming up to the sky)
You're going to have to kill me!  Come on!

Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck.  Truman continues
to head into the teeth of the gale.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES, CHRISTOF gives an
outward appearance of calm.  However a bead of sweat appearing
at his temple betrays him.

SIMEON
(agitated)
It's not working.  He can sail that thing!

ROMAN
How can he sail?!  He's in insurance!  He
hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!

MOSES
(to Christof)
On the behalf of the studio, I demand you
cease transmission.

CHRISTOF
(defiant, to Operators)
Keep running!
(to Moses)
I take full responsibility.
(to Operator in front of radar-style screen)
How close?

OPERATOR
Very close.

CHRISTOF
Capsize him!  Tip him over!

CHLOE
(unable to contain herself
any longer, entreating him)
You can't!  He's tied himself to the wheel.
He'll drown!

SIMEON
(staring at Truman on the monitor,
becoming affected by his display of courage)
He doesn't care...

CHLOE
(to Christof, lunging for the control panel)
You lied, you hypocrite!  The only way he can
leave, is dead!

Chloe lunges for the control panel but Christof throws her to
the floor.

CHRISTOF
(enraged)
Do it!

All eyes turn in Christof's direction, as he confirms Chloe's
accusation.

SIMEON
(staring at the On-Air monitor, numb)
It's too late...


EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm,
each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping
his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright,
his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning
out of control.  His will, draining away.

As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his
arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in
pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the
wheel.  He braces for one last wave.

But the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring
in the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean
swell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of
calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.

The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.
Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane".

After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the
horizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest
shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.
It is certainly not the moon.

The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is
exposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being
caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on
either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.
In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in
both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,
the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.

Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed
half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its
length equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms
perpetually churn.

Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly
past the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is
dead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his
eyes.

But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to
comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that
greets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow
collision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon
line recedes no more.

The sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too
apparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of
colossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.
Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the
sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.

The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping
gently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings
and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the
rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the
painted cyclorama.  He touches the sky.

He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.
Hie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face
into it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A
primal scream.  A pained, animal howl.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Truman's reaction
in silence.


INT/EXT.  BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.  DUSK.

TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and
streets - wherever a television is to be found.  No VIEWER
speaks.  They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.


EXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DUSK.

As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve
of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in
the otherwise flawless backdrop.  He clambers to the prow of the
boat.

There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water
line, is a door.  Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle
and halts the drifting boat.  He stands in front of the door and
closes his eyes in a silent prayer.

He opens the door in the sky and steps through.


INT/EXT.  VIEWERS.  DUSK.

Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
various locations - bars, homes and offices.  Strangers hug each
other and dance in celebration.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

Even the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the
first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting
himself for a moment, caught up in the drama.

OPERATOR
Yeah!

Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.  His
COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing
to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky -
Truman out of view.


INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.  A steel ladder
rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so
high as to be barely visible.  The rungs also continue downward,
the depth of the "ocean-bed", to a studio floor far below.

Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just
entered.  Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away.
The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an
enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an
elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large
soundstage.

Truman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to
his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, "CLOSED SET.
No Unauthorized Access."  Gradually he becomes aware of another
strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around
him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to
masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an
automatic timer.  (The light fixtures match the one that almost
struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.)

By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the
step ladder.  Below, a studio tram makes its way along the
soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.


INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his
tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to
the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS.

GUIDE
...the soundstage roof houses over eight
hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
to faithfully recreate the constellations...

However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual.
They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the
Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot
of the open door in the sky.


INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.  The TOUR GUIDE
stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.  The Guide looks
from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to
believe his eyes.

Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of
the guide's head.

TRUMAN
(to the shocked passengers)
Nobody move!
(to the guide)
Drive!

The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the
tour.

TRUMAN
(to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)
Keep talking.  Say whatever you say!

The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone.

GUIDE
Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred
and fifty million gallons of man-made salt
water, temperature-controlled...

Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -
"TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR".  He is suddenly aware of the tourists
gawking at him.

TRUMAN
(to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)
Act normal!  Keep filming!

Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS
speeds towards the tram.  But they streak past, on their way to
the site of Truman's escape.  As he tentatively gets back to his
feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an
autograph book.

CHILD
Please, Mister Truman.

On the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the
balance of power taking place behind his back.  The executives,
MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he
appears to welcome.

CHRISTOF
(into the phone)
What do you mean he's not there?  We can't
have lost him again.

On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved
glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by.


INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still
trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall
displaying pictures from every facet of his life.

His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private
spot where he and SYLVIA met.

GUIDE
...on your left, the control room where the
angles are selected and the actors receive
direction.  Of course, the one place we can't
show you is the story department.  There is none.
(hesitant)
...Truman writes the script...

From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.  She has a
pure white envelope in her hands.  As Christof looks up to
acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the
tram.


INT.  STUDIO LOT.  DUSK.

Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard
of an indoor shopping mall.  Truman gift shops.

TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays
full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles
such as, "TrumanTrivia".  Video cassettes offering "Truman
Highlights".  His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs
and posters.  Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying
Oldsmobile are offered for sale.

The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end.
STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.  Truman,
using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.

GUIDE
(frightened for his life)
Here he is!  It's him!

Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and
makes a run for it.  The guards give chase.  Truman runs into a
lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his
own, promoting "TrumanWear".  He pulls his "double" to the
ground to block the guards' path.

Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.

GUARD
(into radio)
We've got him trapped.

Truman enters a doorway marked "NO ENTRY" to find a stairway
leading upwards.  He takes the stairs three at a time.

The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.  Flight
after flight of stairs.  At one point, he loses his grip on the
stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for
an eternity down the stairwell.

He finally emerges on a landing.  Lungs bursting.  One more
door.  He tries the handle.  It opens.


EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.  Outside.
Really outside for the first time in his life.

He looks frantically around him.  Nowhere to hide.  The
soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the
eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof.

Facing him, a colossal Burbank.  Several other soundstages
almost as gigantic as his own.  The palm trees lining the
streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns.

The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of
traffic, twenty lanes wide.  Gargantuan office buildings
eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known.

Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its
arched entranceway.

Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.  The real
moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating
for the last thirty-four years.

Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.  A
GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent
in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape.

Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the
background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives,
MOSES and ROMAN.  In front of them, the co-stars in his life -
MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead
father KIRK.  No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the
familiar faces.  Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the
eye.

Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing
at the head of the group.  CHRISTOF.  He approaches Truman
alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a
father calls to a son.

CHRISTOF
Truman...

Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his
life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.  As they
stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first
time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.  For a
moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.

TRUMAN
(quietly, half to himself,
half to Christof)
Even the stars I wished on...

As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly
lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping
from Christof's hand.  With a strength he never knew he
possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage
roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world.

Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.  The
studio guards dare not move.

CHRISTOF
(staring into the chasm,
remaining eerily calm)
You won't do it, Truman.  I've watched you
your whole life.

TRUMAN
(meeting Christof's gaze)
You never had a camera in my head.

Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he
has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life.

TRUMAN
(incensed)
Something was real!
(a terrifying anguish)
Something had to be real!

It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the
abyss.  Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white
envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in
the moonlight.

Truman follows Christof's gaze.  Contemptuously tossing Christof
aside, he retrieves the envelope.  Christof crawls to safety,
thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and
insignificant.

But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer
exist in Truman's mind.  Truman gazes at his name for a long
moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully
breaks the seal.  Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to
be slowly revealed.  A photograph.  A close up of SYLVIA's face
including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose.

A serenity comes over Truman.  He lifts up his eyes to the
mountains on the far horizon.  As he stands on the very edge of
the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we
commence a long, slow pull-back.

Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall
of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic
picture of his face and proclaiming, "TRUMAN - Total Record of a
Human Life.  34TH GREAT YEAR!"

We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on
top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.


A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS

The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the
two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar,
PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by
their television sets.

We focus on the screen of a television.  A small FEMALE BABY
sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old
suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his
life.  The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress
VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.  A border
around the action on the screen announces, "ZOE - Total
Record Of a Human Life".

Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen.
A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the
television set in Sylvia's house.

TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the
air, much to the child's delight.  Truman dwells for a moment
on the mirror-image scene on the television before very
deliberately shutting it off.

SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.  Together, they exit
the beach house.  We follow them as they make their way onto the
deserted sand and down towards the sea.

FADE OUT
